      "blog_post": "Whether you're dreaming of raising goats or you want to add a chicken coop to your backyard, you don't have to start from scratch. Many farmers and those dedicated to rural living document their experiences through blogs, and we've rounded up 11 of the most entertaining and informative ones on the Web. They're worth checking out — even if you just want to see pictures of baby animals and have no real farming ambitions. \n\n 1. Our Little Coop\n\n\"Raising children, chickens and everything in between,\" Emily McGrath blogs from Illinois where she lives with her writer/gardener husband, their kids and a backyard chicken coop. McGrath discusses everything from how to build a coop and care for newborn chicks to great recipes for all those farm-fresh eggs.\n2. Stories From the Farm\n\nThis blog is worth visiting just for the adorableness factor; the photos of baby Jacob sheep are the site's hands-down highlight. Blogger Shannon Phifer is a skilled photographer and she shares striking images of the sheep, as well as the ducks, dogs, cats and chickens that call this Oregon farm home.\n3. Northview Diary\n\nAround for nearly a decade, this farming blog waxes poetic about life on a dairy farm in New York. This diary of a dairy has lovely narration about everything from cows to dogs to weather, including this turn of phrase: \"Sometimes the cold is a knife, cutting through whatever you wear, and biting at your flesh, like a frenzied fox.\"\n4. Juniper Moon Farm\ntwo sheep named Wembley and Margaret from Juniper Moon Farm\n\nFormer network news producer Susan Gibbs left New York City in search of \"a more authentic life.\" After reading a how-to book on raising sheep, she found that new life on Juniper Moon Farm in Virginia where she raises bees, sheep, goats, pigs, cows, chickens and more. She also makes beautiful yarn that is available in shops throughout the U.S. and Canada.\n5. Unexpected Farmer\n\nThis entertaining blog details life on a farm in Gran Canaria, Spain, with two kids, three dogs, six cats, and a slew of bunnies, ducks, horses and chickens. The ex-pat newbie farmer behind the blog details her never-ending adventures like the time someone handed her a duck in a box at the post office and just walked away.\n6. Farmgirl Follies\nblue jars have crystals in the making at Farmgirl Follies blog\n\nFarmgirl Jennifer Kiko, who makes a home with her Farmguy in rural Ohio, blogs about family, food, homeschooling, faith, rustic farmhouse finds and a simpler, peaceful life. Her home base is Tuckaway Farm, which has been in her family for seven generations and is next door to a vineyard owned by her brother.\n7. The Milk Maid Marian\n\nMarian Macdonald blogs about the day-to-day life of an Australian dairy farmer in Gippsland, Victoria. The farm, which has been in the family for generations, is rain-fed rather than irrigated. Macdonald shares cow stories and photos, including a special focus on one of her favorite cows, aptly named \"Cheeky Girl.\"\n8. Bee Haven Acres\ntwo mini horses stick their heads through the fence at Bee Haven acres\n\nBlogger Bev's Bee Haven Acres in Central Pennsylvania is home to a herd of fainting goats and Nigerian dwarf goats, as well as horses, pigs and chickens. Bev talks about her family's organic farming (they grow their own blueberries and apples and collect their own honey and eggs) and makes vintage-inspired aprons.\n9. Tiny Farm Blog\n\nThis online photographic journal offers a day-to-day look at growing food on a small scale from a two-acre plot in southern Ontario. There are plenty of beautiful photos of farm-fresh crops, as well as lots of DIY organic practical advice — including pest controls, tools, seed starting — if you want to try it yourself.\n10. A Year in Redwood\nblack and white photo of tree and farm from Year in Redwood blog\n\nMargaret O’Farrell left the life of a Dublin city girl behind when she and her husband, \"Farmer Alfie,\" moved to North Tipperary to a farm and bed and breakfast. The blog is about food, gardening, life in the country and photography as Margaret chats about raising their own pigs and goats — and selling free-range, GMO-free pork and bacon — and most of their own vegetables.\n11. The Beginning Farmer\n\nEthan and Becca Book got into farming — specifically grass-fed cattle — to lower his soaring cholesterol levels. With no experience, they built a home on 40 acres in Iowa, and Ethan now covers the daily trials and fun of life on Crooked Gap Farm. The popular blog has spun off a podcast, and Becca also does The Beginning Farmer's Wife blog.\n",

      "blog_post": " One of the more frustrating roadblocks in navigating the COVID-19 pandemic was the difficulty in getting quick, accurate test results. Sometimes, results for PCR tests took up to two weeks, rendering their diagnosis useless for planning isolation scenarios. Meanwhile, rapid tests still oftentimes provide a false negative if taken too soon after infection. When I had COVID, I was four days into symptoms before I got a positive at-home test—I've heard many people recount similar stories.\n\nThe testing we have is certainly better than nothing, but it leaves a lot to be desired. If only there were a better way, say, using something with remarkable innate sensitivity. Like, dogs. Far-fetched? Not at all.\n\nA review of recent research concluded that scent dogs may represent a cheaper, faster, and more effective way to detect COVID-19 and could be a key tool in future pandemics. This could be a game-changer for sustainability as well, eliminating the enormous amount of waste that comes with billions of testing kits.\n\nThe review, published in De Gruyter's Journal of Osteopathic Medicine, found that scent dogs are as effective, or even more effective, than conventional COVID-19 tests such as PCR tests.\n\nMost of us know that dogs have a remarkable sense of smell; they sniff out drugs and explosives and have even successfully identified patients with certain cancers, Parkinson’s, and diabetes. They have up to 300 million olfactory cells, compared to 5 or 6 million in humans. And they use one-third of their brains to process scent information—humans just use 5%.\n6 Medical Conditions That Dogs Can Sniff Out\n\nProfessor Tommy Dickey of the University of California, Santa Barbara, and Heather Junqueira of BioScent Detection Dogs analyzed 29 different studies in which dogs detected COVID-19. \"The studies were performed using over 31,000 samples by over 400 scientists from more than 30 countries using 19 different dog breeds. In some studies, the scent dogs sniffed people directly, sometimes in public places as a health screening. In others, the dogs sniffed patient samples such as sweat, saliva, or urine samples,\" explains a press statement from De Gruyter.\nDogs' Incredible Accuracy\n\nThe dogs ranged from Labrador retrievers and Belgian malinois to beagles and English springer spaniels. In most of the studies, the dogs demonstrated similar or better sensitivity and specificity than the current gold-standard PCR tests or antigen tests.\n\n\"In one study, four of the dogs could detect the equivalent of less than 2.6 x 10−12 copies of viral RNA per milliliter. This is equivalent to detecting one drop of any odorous substance dissolved in ten and a half Olympic-sized swimming pools and is three orders of magnitude better than modern scientific instruments,\" notes De Gruyter.\n\nRemarkably, they not only detected COVID-19 in symptomatic, pre-symptomatic, and asymptomatic patients, but they could also sniff out COVID variants and even long COVID.\nConsidering the Safety of the Dogs\n\nOne thing we certainly don't want is for dogs to become collateral damage in the pursuit of better testing. The study authors acknowledge this, writing that the \"safety of scent dogs, their handlers, and those who are inspected by the dogs is critical for the acceptance and implementation of the scent dog screening and testing approach.\"\n\n\"This is consistent with the One Health paradigm,\" they add, \"which defines health as more than the absence of disease and recognizes the interrelationships among humans, animals, and environmental welfare.\"\n\nThe authors evaluated whether medical detection dogs could contract and become ill with the COVID-19 virus and if dogs pass on the COVID-19 virus to humans. From a number of studies, they concluded that dogs are in the low-risk category. \"To our knowledge, there have been no deaths of dogs that can be unequivocally attributed to COVID-19,\" the authors explain. \"Importantly, the studies described above suggest that it is safe for healthy individual handlers to utilize scent dogs to directly screen and test individuals who may be infected with the COVID-19 virus.\"\nSpeedy Test Results\n\nA major benefit of using the dogs is their speed. In one study, researchers were able to do a lineup with 40 samples, including sample collection, lineup loading, and unloading, within just 3  minutes.\n\n\"The time between RT-PCR sampling and the return of results can be up to days, whereas the RAG test results are obtained within about 15 min.,\" write the study authors. \"Again, if scent dogs directly sniff individuals, results are learned in seconds, or a few minutes if samples are taken and sniffed soon after by the dogs.\"\n\n\"The criticality of the speed of the return of test results cannot be overemphasized,\" the authors add.\nElimination of Plastic Waste\n\nThat dogs could provide a result in seconds to minutes is crucial. But additionally, and importantly, scent tests by dogs don't require expensive lab equipment or create mountains of plastic waste, unlike conventional diagnostic approaches.\n\nAs of December 22, 2022, the United States alone had performed around 1.15 billion tests for COVID-19. Thinking of all the material for the testing kits and all the resources used for testing labs and sending samples around, etc., the reduction in ecological footprint is potentially tremendous.\n\nNot to mention the cost. Some of the research in the review was, in fact, motivated by the need for inexpensive testing in developing nations, the authors note.\n\n“Although many people have heard about the exceptional abilities of dogs to help humans, their value to the medical field has been considered fascinating, but not ready for real-world medical use,” says Dickey. “Having conducted this review, we believe that scent dogs deserve their place as a serious diagnostic methodology that could be particularly useful during pandemics, potentially as part of rapid health screenings in public spaces. We are confident that scent dogs will be useful in detecting a wide variety of diseases in the future.\" ",

      "blog_post": " Are you successful in your garden? This is a question that is not as easy to answer as you might think. I have been thinking lately about how we should measure success in a garden and why it is important to answer this question as a sustainable gardener.\nWhy Does Measuring Success Matter in a Garden?\n\nYou might wonder why we need to think about success in a garden at all. Why do we need to think about things in terms of successes or failures? Can't we just enjoy our gardens and our gardening without having to know how well we are doing?\n\nOf course, gardening is not always about results. Often, we may simply enjoy growing a little of our own food or some pretty flowers without thinking too much about how well things are going.\n\nBut measuring success can be important because it can help us to understand our goals and how we are measuring up against those goals. It can help us to see more clearly what has worked and what has not in our gardens and to dictate our course moving forwards.\n\nBy measuring our success, we can see where we, as gardeners, are truly helping to make our world a better place and also where we may be falling short.\n\nMeasuring success can also help to encourage us—helping us to avoid that well-known slump when things do not always go according to plan. Seeing what we have done right and where we have succeeded can make sure we remain inspired and excited about what we are doing in our gardens.\nDeciding What We Mean By Success\n\nIn order to measure success, we first need to determine what we mean by success. We need to ask ourselves what it means for something to go right and the metrics by which we can determine whether or not we are heading in the correct direction.\n\nSuccess in a garden will mean different things to different people. We might think about success in terms of the appearance of a garden. We might look carefully, observe, and monitor how a garden looks when compared with original designs or plans.\n\nWe might measure progress towards meeting specific goals that we set earlier on in our gardening journey. For example, we might have determined to overcome a particular challenge in the environment in which we grow. Or we might have lofty goals like self-sufficiency when it comes to food.\n\nThe success of a garden might often be measured by taking a look at its yields (strictly tangible, or tangible and intangible). The yields that a garden can provide often focus on food. But of course there are numerous things a garden can provide.\n\nEnvironmentalists can look at a number of metrics when trying to determine success in a garden. They might look, for example, at specific species, species numbers, or species diversity.\n\nBiodiversity in a garden is often considered one key measure of success. So we might look at the diversity of both plant species and local wildlife within the space.\nHow to Measure Success\n\nOften, to measure success in a garden, we need only look and learn, comparing what we have now to our permaculture designs or thinking about how they fit with the goals that we had earlier for the space.\n\nTo measure yields, at least tangible ones, we can easily weigh the produce that we grow. We can count the number of calories we grow. Or we can count specific fruits or vegetables to see how the harvest compares to the previous years.\n\nMeasuring success can sometimes be as simple as measuring yields and noting how the yields have increased with our decisions and efforts over time.\n\nMeasuring yields can be one simple way to see how well we have done. But it is important to remember that there are also intangible yields—ones that are not as easy to measure. How can we quantify the joy we experience from spending time in a beautiful and productive garden?\n\nWe can also count plant species and wildlife, but need to remember to look at the big picture to truly see how the garden ecosystem in functioning as a whole.\n\nCounting and measuring is important, but we should also remember to look beyond the facts and figures to see what we have really achieved and all that the garden can truly do for us.

      "blog_post": "\n\nNASA's $1.2 billion Surface Water and Ocean Topography satellite (SWOT) successfully launched from California on December 16, marking the start of an unprecedented mission to map Earth's water bodies.\n\n“It’s a game changer,” Rosemary Morrow, oceanographer at the Laboratory of Space, Geophysical and Oceanographic Studies and one of the science leads for the mission, told Nature. “It will be like putting on a pair of glasses when you are short-sighted: things are sort of vague, and then suddenly everything comes into clarity.”\n\nDeveloped over nearly two decades as part of a joint project with the French National Centre for Space Studies, SWOT will use advanced radar to measure the elevation, extent, and movement of water across the planet. Such insights will help researchers better understand the global water cycle and the impacts of climate change, and provide crucial information to help communities manage their water resources.\n\n“From a societal point of view—whether you’re looking at drinking water, navigation, flood control— water needs to be managed at basin scale,” SWOT science team member Sylvain Biancamaria shared in a mission brief. “Therefore, observations covering the entire basin are needed, and SWOT will provide such data sets.”\nAn Unprecedented Map of Nearly All Earth’s Freshwater Sources\n\nWhat’s perhaps most enlightening about SWOT’s mission is just how little data we currently have on Earth’s freshwater bodies. According to Tamlin Pavelsky, NASA freshwater science lead for SWOT, we only have information on a couple thousand lakes around the world. Thanks to the satellite’s ability to measure and map 95% of lakes greater than 15 acres (6 hectares) and rivers wider than 330 feet (100 meters) across, Pavelsky says that number will grow to “between 2 million and 6 million.”1\n\nBy measuring and monitoring the height, extent, and surface area of nearly 1.3 million miles of Earth’s freshwater sources, the SWOT research team says they can more accurately gauge how climate change is impacting our planet’s water cycle. \n\n\"This is important because as the climate warms, oceans are rising,\" Karen St. Germain, director of NASA's Earth Science Division, told reporters via ZDnet. \"Our coastlines are changing, and we're seeing large fluctuations in inland water bodies—lakes, reservoirs and rivers.\" \nMagnifying Impacts From Climate Change\n\nAccording to NASA, the ocean has absorbed more than 90% of the heat trapped by human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. Much of the continued uptake is thought to occur around currents and eddies less than 60 miles across, ocean features previously too small to study accurately from space. SWOT changes all of that, with a 10-fold improvement in the spatial resolution of water height measurement.2\n\nBy better understanding how climate change is impacting eddies and currents, estimated to account for up to half the heat and carbon transfer from surface waters to the ocean’s depths, researchers hope they can determine the ocean’s ability to capture future heat and emissions. \n\n“What is the turning point at which the ocean starts releasing huge amounts of heat back into the atmosphere and accelerating global warming, rather than limiting it?” Nadya Vinogradova Shiffer, SWOT’s program scientist, said. “SWOT can help answer one of the most critical climate questions of our time.”\n\nAfter six months of calibration, SWOT will enter an orbit roughly 554 miles above the planet and begin mapping its surface water. This process will repeat every 21 days, producing a steady stream of data that NASA plans to make public and provide tools for easier access. While the satellite has a scheduled lifespan of three years, SWOT project manager Thierry Lafon says we’ll likely have this advanced eye in the sky for decades to come. \n\n\"Our system will not limit the lifetime if everything is OK on board,\" he told Space.com before launch. \"Five years is completely reasonable, and [perhaps] many more years, as we've been doing for 30 years.\"\n",

      "blog_post": " Many farmers are well aware that organic farming is a good thing to do. But knowing that something is right and actually implementing it fully are two very different things. Many farmers, even those who are sympathetic to the ideas we espouse and have a favorable option of organic production, may struggle to see how it is actually real-world feasible to make the switch. \n\nAs a permaculture designer and consultant, I often help small-scale farmers, market gardeners, or homesteaders move towards more sustainable enterprise on their properties, and so I thought I would share a few simple tips to help anyone who wants to convert an existing growing business to organic production. \nUnderstand Organic Farming Legislation Where You Live\n\nFirst things first, understand that sometimes, in certain jurisdictions in particular, conversion to organic production is about more than just farming organically. There can be a plethora of forms to fill in and red tape to wade through before you can actually be certified and be allowed to sell \"organic\" label produce. \n\nAs well as familiarizing yourself with the legislation and requirements for organic farming where you live, it can also be very useful to speak with those who have already gone through the process and who are growing organically—ideally in a location nearby and on land similar to your own. \n\nWhile you can read about things all day, actually speaking with someone with their hands in the dirt and real-world experience can make all the difference. It can open your eyes to potential problems of all kinds, but also bring clarity about the achievability of your organic farming goals. \nSourcing Seeds\n\nOn any arable farm, sourcing organic seeds will be one key part of the puzzle. Fortunately, today, organic seeds are more widely available than they once were. And you can potentially buy just once, then convert to saving your own seed for subsequent years in order to keep costs down. \n\nWhile this may not be feasible for all farms, seed saving is one potential way to reduce operational costs for a small-scale food-growing business. You would only be able to use your own seed and call it organic once the conversion period has elapsed. \nManaging Soil Health and Fertility\n\nOrganic farming is about far more than just the avoidance of certain products. It is also focused on holistic land management and, crucially, on maintaining a healthy and fertile soil ecosystem. \n\nKey things to think about when it comes to managing soil health and fertility are:\n\n    Crop rotation and crop sequence to balance demands on the soil. \n    Using legumes/dynamic accumulators and/or animal manures to cycle nutrients through the system. \n    Management of waste and the creation of closed-loop systems. \n\nWhile certain inputs for fertility are allowed in organic crop production, your goal, both for optimal production and for financial reasons, should be to minimize additional inputs required as much as possible. \nWeeds, Pests, and Disease Control\n\nIt is important to understand that you will have weeds, pests, and diseases on an organic farm. The key, of course, is to maintain a natural balance so that none of these problems are able to proliferate too much or get out of control. \n\nPests and diseases are typically the easier things to manage in organic arable farming. Begin with healthy soil, which will yield healthier and more resistant plants. \n\nIntegrated pest management, with strategic sowing times, crop rotation, physical barriers where required, and, most crucially, the boosting of biodiversity and the attraction of natural predators, can all keep crops safer and reduce crop damage and losses. \n\nHowever, there will be times in organic production when the \"nuclear option\" is required, and certain organic pest control products might be used. \n\nWeed control requires significant consideration in organic conversion and can sometimes be one of the most challenging aspects. \n\nBut using both mechanical and cultural methods, and timing these correctly, can mean that the transition goes more smoothly than it might otherwise do. Dense sowing, the use of mulches, and the reduction of bare soil and soil disturbance will all play their roles in keeping weed pressures under control.\nLivestock Systems Organic Conversion \n\nIf you have livestock on your small farm then organic conversion can be more complex than for non-integrated arable systems. However, one might argue that the rewards are even greater when the conversion is complete (both in \"real\" value and in financial terms for a farming business). \n\nIn livestock farming systems, you will need to think about what you feed to livestock and where they are housed. \n\nYou may also have to consider where your breeding stock comes from, and you will need to make sure that you have a feasible and well-thought-out livestock management plan in place. You need to consider veterinarian treatments and how grassland will be managed short and longer term. \n\nThinking carefully about how you will manage each of these issues will help you determine the shape of your new enterprise and see how things will alter from your current practices. \n\nGet a clear idea before you begin, and you are far less likely to fall at the first hurdle during the organic conversion process.

      "blog_post": " Have you ever been somewhere truly free from the sounds of humankind? We become immune to the sounds of distant traffic and especially the subtle hum of planes above, but there are few places that don't have some form of noise pollution.\n\nNoise pollution is noise that has surpassed ambient noise levels and has a harmful impact on humans and animals. This type of pollution is generated by humans and is a form of environmental degradation. It can serve as a source of stress on fauna, can have negative effects on animal welfare, and can even cause behavioral changes in birds, according to a study on the impacts of noise pollution on birds. \nMap of noise pollution in the United States\nMap showing noise caused by road, rail, and aviation. Photo from U.S Dept. of Transportation, National Transportation Noise Map.\n\nNoise pollution can be problematic when frequencies that are produced disrupt information transmission in animals, specifically animals that use similar frequencies to communicate. These disturbances can also lead to higher anti-predator behaviors in situations that don’t require it, as well as change species vocalization, increase stress and stress-related diseases, and have the potential to decrease populations.\nNoise Pollution Facts\n\n    The third most common chronic physical condition in the United States is hearing loss. (CDC)\n    Over 100 million people in the European Union are exposed to traffic noise above 55 decibels (dB), according to a study looking at noise pollution and its health effects.\n    Noise over 70 dB over a long period of time can damage your hearing, and noise above 120 dB can cause immediate damage to your ears. The average sound of a firework is 140 dB, and the average sound of traffic (from inside the car) is 80 to 85 dB. (CDC)\n    Noise pollution threatens the survival of over 100 species.\n\nWhat is Noise Pollution?\n\nNoise pollution can also be defined as an unwanted sound. The noise that is studied usually refers to occupational noise instead of social noise or environmental noise like construction.\n\nIn the E.U., around 56 million who live in areas with a population size of more than 250,000 people are exposed to more than average traffic noise. In the United States, noise has been shown to be increasing in California due to street traffic and increased at a rate of 6.7 dBA (A-weighted decibels). \n\nNoise pollution's impact on the environment can be classified as:\n\n    Chronic Contamination / Continuous Noise: Constant exposure to noise; this type of pollution can lead to hearing impairment.\n    Temporary Contamination with Physiological Damage: Exposure to a limited source of noise; an example is exposure to explosives.\n    Temporary Pollution Without Damage: Continuous noise for a limited period of time, like street noise—this can lead to temporary hearing impairments.\n\nMeanwhile, low-frequency noise is described as the background noise that comes from urban environments like air conditioning systems or vehicles. Traffic accounts for 80% of the environmental impact of noise. In animals, traffic noise can reduce foraging efficiency, and in birds can affect their reproductive system.\nExamples of Noise Pollution\n\nBarcelona, Spain\n\nBarcelona is among the top cities exposed to noise pollution. Almost 48% of city blocks had an average noise level over 65dB, and only 5% of city blocks had noise levels under 55dB, according to research on environmental noise inequities in the city. The area with the highest noise level was the Eixample district; this district has high flows of street traffic and is also where the very popular La Sagrada Familia is located. This district, as well as the Sarria-Sant Gervasi district, experience levels over 70dB. In Barcelona, 94% of the population lives in city blocks that experience high-noise levels. In Madrid, 80% of all urban noise comes from road traffic, according to an impact assessment of traffic noise in Madrid. In general, the E.U. has shown that 65% of Europeans live in major urban areas that are exposed to high noise levels.\n\nNew York City, United States\n\nNoise has been consistently reported as the number-one quality-of-life issue affecting residents in New York City. Sound pressure levels were reported at 70 to 85 dB in midtown Manhattan, which is above average and is at a level that poses health hazards, according to an assessment of noise pollution in NYC. More than two million people in New York City reported that they were disturbed from sleep by noise once a week; 78% of those people reported being disturbed three or more nights each week, according to a paper on the effects of ambient noise on sleep. Traffic noise caused 53% of sleep disturbances. Measured locations in New York City with noise levels greater than 70dB increased risk of hearing loss. These noise levels were especially high in areas with a lot of traffic, during the morning and evening commuting periods, and all around Manhattan, as reported in an assessment of street-level noise in New York City. The assessment also found that the highest noise measurement occurred when sirens, heavy pedestrian traffic, or construction was present. Street-level noises contribute to 4% of total noise exposed to the NYC public.\nNoise Pollution and the Clean Air Act\n\nThe Clean Air Act Amendment added Title IV to the document, which relates to noise pollution. This amendment established the EPA Office of Noise Abatement and Control to study the effect of noise on public health and the effect on wildlife, the psychological and physiological effects it may have on people, and the effect of sporadic extreme noise. The sources of noise that are regulated by the EPA include construction equipment, trucks, transport equipment, low-noise emission products, and rail and motor carriers. It also regulates the labeling of hearing protection devices.  During the time this amendment was written, the EPA identified the average exposure to environmental noise to be 70 dB over 24 hours and average levels of 55 dB outdoors. However, the Office of Noise Abatement and Control was closed as the administration thought it was best if issues regarding noise were handled at the local and State level, according to the EPA.\n\nThe Noise Control Act of 1972 and the Quiet Communities Act essentially replaced the office and have yet to be rescinded, however the EPA’s website states they are “essentially unfunded.” Since the Clean Air Act and the previously mentioned amendment are no longer enforced, people can look at their state’s regulations. For example, Colorado limits the decibels produced by noise in residential, commercial, light industrial, and industrial zones between a set time. Their statute also considers periodic, intrusive, or shrill noises as a nuisance. The California Noise Control Act reiterates the harm excessive noise can have on physiological and psychological health, and also states that people in California are entitled to having a “peaceful and quiet” environment without noise that could be hazardous to their health.\nEffects of Noise Pollution on Wildlife\n\nThe greatest effect of noise pollution on the environment is on animals. Noise pollution can affect an animal's ability to detect acoustic signals, affect courtship behaviors, cause birds to produce fewer eggs, and cause fewer offspring to reach reproductive age. On detecting acoustic signals, noise can also be produced in the same frequencies in which animals vocalize and can interrupt the transmission of information.\n\nNoise affects many species of animals, from amphibians, arthropods, birds, and fish to mammals, mollusks, and reptiles.\nNoise Pollution Is a Major Threat to Many Different Kinds of Animals, Study Finds\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, noise is one of the most hazardous forms of pollution and has become omnipresent in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.\nHow Noise Affects Animals\n\n    It hampers communication. Most animals rely on vocalizations and other acoustic signals to communicate with each other. Interference makes it challenging for animals to find mates, warn of danger, establish territories, and coordinate group activities.\n    It disrupts reproduction: Noise pollution is distracting and can disrupt breeding behaviors and lead to diminished reproductive success. For instance, loud noises near nesting sites can cause birds to abandon their nests.\n    It compromises dwindling habitat: Noise can reduce the quality of usable habitat, something that is already in critical decline.\n    It alters foraging patterns: Noise pollution can change the foraging patterns of animals. For example, ship noise can cause marine mammals to avoid certain feeding grounds.\n    It leads to stress and health issues: Just like in human animals, prolonged exposure to loud and constant noise can lead to chronic stress in non-human animals, which can have many adverse effects.\n    It drowns out environmental cues: Noise pollution can make it hard to hear important environmental cues that animals have always relied on to navigate and detect predators or prey.\n    It disorients and can cause strandings: Particularly in aquatic environments, noise—like that from ships or oil extraction activities—can disorient marine animals and lead to beach strandings or collisions with boats.\n\nThese disturbances can have long-term consequences. For example, some species may perform anti-predator behavior due to the confusion noise may create, as is the case with the impact of noise pollution on the saffron finch.\n\nIn this case, the noise created by traffic changed the behavior of saffron finches and made them less aggressive. In an environment with heavy noise, the male bird would display less aggressive behaviors when confronted by an intruding bird. This may be because they pay less attention to the intruder if unwanted noise masks the information that dictates the attributes of the intruder. The study predicts that if noise pollution were to continue, this species would continue to exhibit anti-predator behavior, as well as eat and reproduce less. This type of behavioral change was also found in the chipping sparrow.\nWhat Can Be Done?\nPedestrians in Hong Kong\nCharles O'Rear / Getty Images\n\nTrees can be used against noise pollution, according to an investigation on the effects of leaves, branches, and canopies on noise pollution. By decreasing the area in which noise is made and increasing tree presence with tree belts of at least 12 meters, trees could serve as a noise barrier in urban areas. Another study found that tree belts with a width of 30 meters could be planted on the roadside and have more than 6dB reduction of noise than a grassland would. The conclusion was that more trees, branches, and leaves could reduce noise pollution.\nHow Do Trees Reduce Noise Pollution?\n\nRegulations have also been placed in the U.S. statewide and local governments to reduce noise pollution. New York, for example, has a regulation that looks at occupational noise exposure; this ranges from monitoring noise to providing personal protective equipment. Many states and local governments in the U.S. have their own regulations regarding noise pollution; however, many focus on the human impacts that noise pollution has and not the environmental impacts.\nHow Can You Help?\n\n    Advocate for planting trees and vegetation, or plant trees yourself. Trees can serve as a great noise barrier and have many other benefits as well.\n    Turn down the volume on your television, music, and car stereo—especially in urban and residential areas where people can overhear your entertainment.\n    If you own a car or motorcycle, ensure it's well-maintained to minimize engine noise.\n    Check your road rage and limit unnecessary honking.\n    Limit the use of loud machinery or equipment.\n    Opt for electric gardening equipment—gas-powered lawnmowers and leafblowers are a bane for your neighbors.\n    Opt for an electric car, which reduces engine noise from traffic.\n    Use soundproofing in your home or workspace to decrease the noise you hear and the noise you emit.\n    Advocate for quiet zones in public places, like parks, libraries, or public transportation.\n    Research and support local and national noise-reduction policies and regulations.\n    Become active in local community initiatives to reduce noise pollution, such as organizing noise awareness campaigns or supporting noise-reduction projects.\n\n",

      "blog_post": " There's been a shift in recent years in sustainability circles about what exactly constitutes green building. Does it mean demolishing old, underperforming structures and building new, energy-efficient buildings with sustainable materials? Or can green building also mean preserving and reusing older buildings—by readapting them for new purposes by retrofitting them to more modern and greener standards?\n\nBut as we begin to ask \"why\" we build instead of \"how,\" it's becoming more and more apparent that the latter path means avoiding the greater upfront carbon emissions that a new build might entail, and that's why preservation can be a form of climate action.\n\nA great example of how preservation goes hand-in-hand with building sustainably can be found in Australia, where there is a growing trend of renovating and retrofitting older workers' cottages and other 19th-century terrace homes for modern use. In extending a century-old terrace house in an inner suburb of Melbourne, local firm Austin Design Associates managed to create an eye-catching contrast between traditional and modern elements.\n\nAs regulations for heritage-status homes like this one go, the character and height of the original front facade have to be maintained. However, there is more leeway at the rear to add a taller addition, as this renovation of the Richmond House has done.\nRichmond House renovation by Austin Design Associates exterior\n\nSpacecraft\n\nOnce inside, we can see that the designers have completely overhauled the interior to evoke a modern and classy look, with whitewashed walls contrasting against wood, glass, and black metal accents.\n\nHere in the main corridor, we see the original archway has been preserved and highlighted with a semi-circular, metal-framed window above the glass door leading to the main living space. We love how the change between the wood risers to the carpeted steps on the staircase announces a subtle shift from the shared common space downstairs to the more private areas upstairs.\nRichmond House renovation by Austin Design Associates main corridor\n\nSpacecraft\n\nOff to the side of the corridor, we find the bathroom, which has been modernized to have a floating vanity with two sinks, and a sleek shower stall that has a built-in niche for toiletries and a simple glass wall to define it.\nRichmond House renovation by Austin Design Associates bathroom\n\nSpacecraft\n\nThe bathroom also connects to a walk-in closet with plenty of organized storage space, with lots of wood-lined elements to soften the starker colors of white, black, and grey.\nRichmond House renovation by Austin Design Associates walk in closet\n\nSpacecraft\n\nMoving back into the corridor and into the main living area, we see the open-plan kitchen overlapping with the living room beyond. Here, the kitchen features a clean, rectilinear design scheme, consisting of a wall of white cabinetry and white backsplash tiling with black grouting, all of which is offset against the grey-colored countertop and open wooden shelving. The ceiling is lined with wood, which also contrasts well against the polished concrete floor (not the most eco-friendly material, but certainly durable).\n\nThe central kitchen island is the place where the family can gather around for meals. This minimalist piece is warmed up with a top made of natural stone material and a large three-dimensional grid of open shelving that is made with wood. To finish off the look, there are two metal-framed bar-height chairs at one end.\nRichmond House renovation by Austin Design Associates kitchen\n\nSpacecraft\n\nThe living room is warmed up considerably with a palette of warm grey masonry paired with textures of natural brown leather and an off-white, thickly woven carpet. With the full-height glass doors, the interior space is designed to flow out seamlessly with the rear garden space.\nRichmond House renovation by Austin Design Associates living room\n\nSpacecraft\n\nThe black metal wood stove is a welcome addition to this space, sitting on a plinth of that same friendly grey.\nRichmond House renovation by Austin Design Associates wood stove\n\nSpacecraft\n\nDespite its small footprint and hard stone surfaces, the backyard feels incredibly lush, with its walls lined with greenery.\nRichmond House renovation by Austin Design Associates backyard\n\nSpacecraft\n\nWith the right kind of lighting in the right places, the backyard feels like an illuminated haven in the middle of the city.\nRichmond House renovation by Austin Design Associates backyard\n\nSpacecraft\n\nLike so many other examples of outdated housing inventory, older buildings such as this one show that they can indeed be reinvented for modern life—and it is often the choice that is better for the environment and for preserving the historical character of a neighborhood. For the building industry to become more sustainable, preservation and adaptive reuse are critical pieces of the puzzle. To see more, visit Austin Design Associates.",

Deutsche Bahn, the country's main rail operator, issued a statement saying that travelers would be able to choose a \"high-quality porcelain or glass\" option when ordering food and drink on its intercity and high-speed services. \n\nReusable cups, plates, and bowls will be offered to customers free of charge, with no deposit required. Single-use plates and cups made from plastic and cardboard can still be requested if a person prefers them, but the move toward reusables is part of a broader national push to reduce food packaging waste. Starting January 1, 2023, Germany is requiring all restaurants to use reusable packaging for takeout food products, while keeping disposables on hand for special requests.1\n\nDeutsche Bahn points out that a disposable cup has an average lifespan of just 15 minutes before it's thrown away. From its website:\n\n    \"This generates an unimaginable amount of waste every day: according to the German environmental association Deutsche Umwelthilfe, the daily figure in Germany is in the region of 7.6 million cups. That's 320,000 cups every hour. Not only does their production require tens of thousands of metric tons of wood and billions of liters of water, it also often leads to road and environmental pollution.\" \n\nReusable cups, by contrast, reduce waste and save wood, energy, and water. The ones used by DB are also 100% recyclable when they too reach the end of their lives. DB says that replacing a disposable cup with a reusable one saves 21 grams of CO2 and 430 mL (14.5 ounces) of water.2\n\nAs for washing all those reusable cups and dishes, DB doesn't offer much information beyond saying that it considers \"the ecological impact of the detergents that we use in the kitchens of our staff restaurants\" and only buys products that are \"certified in line with the EU's Ecolabel or Nordic Swan standards.\" \n",

      "blog_post": " In a clear case of déjà vu, Hurricane Fiona struck Puerto Rico on Sept. 18, almost five years to the day Hurricane Maria hit the island, showing that, as researchers have long warned, tropical storms are now more frequent and destructive due to man-made climate change.\n\nBack in 2017, Hurricane Maria killed thousands of people and left millions without power for days—some regained access to the grid weeks or months after the disaster. Recovery efforts after the hurricane have been marred by corruption, mismanagement, bureaucracy, and political missteps that left the island vulnerable to another tropical cyclone. \n\nA study released in 2019 found that the likelihood of extreme precipitation events like Hurricane Maria hitting Puerto Rico is now almost five times higher due to the climate crisis.1 \n\nThe storms were similar in many ways but had their own characteristics. Whereas Maria was a Category 4 hurricane that unleashed winds of up to 155 mph, Fiona, a Category 1 storm when it made landfall, was milder, with winds of up to 85 mph, which later increased to 115 mph as the storm progressed through the island. \n\nAnd yet, the torrential downpours caused by Fiona brought Puerto Rico to its knees. According to estimates by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the slow-moving tropical cyclone dumped 15.80 inches of rain over a five-day period, slightly more than Maria at 14.72 inches.\n\nDespite contributing less than 1% of the greenhouse gases emitted since the start of the industrial revolution, small island nations with limited resources are particularly susceptible to the ravages of climate change, including sea level rise, destructive storms, and disruptive rain patterns.\n\nThis confirms another long-held prediction that, with climate change, destructive storms will not only become more common but also wetter. \n\nThat’s because the increase in temperatures is leading to more oceanic evaporation and because warmer air can hold more water vapor. The global average temperature has already increased by nearly 1.2 degrees Celsius (2.2 degrees Fahrenheit) due to the climate crisis and for each degree celsius of warming, the air’s ability to hold water is thought to increase by about 7%.23\n\n\"Extreme Precipitation and Climate Change.\" Center for Climate and Energy Solutions.\nThe latest research suggests that the increase may be three times higher, at 21%.4\n\nThese two factors can cause an increase in extreme precipitation. Since nearly 80% of precipitation occurs over the ocean, islands like Puerto Rico are especially vulnerable.5\n\nAs well as killing 16 people, in Puerto Rico, Fiona triggered flooding that washed out roads, bridges, and power infrastructure, leaving 3.3 million people without electricity. As of yesterday, roughly 349,000 homes and businesses still didn't have power.\n\nPuerto Rico’s electric grid was already in a weak position following a botched attempt to privatize the island’s power sector after Hurricane Maria, which sent electricity prices soaring and failed to prevent crippling blackouts. \nA fallen powerline on the road\nDowned power lines on road PR-743 in Cayey, Puerto Rico as the island awoke to a general power outage in San Juan, Puerto Rico.\n\nJose Jimenez / Getty Images\nMismanagement and Colonialism\n\nDespite contributing less than 1% of the greenhouse gases emitted since the start of the industrial revolution, small island nations with limited resources are particularly susceptible to the ravages of climate change, including sea level rise, destructive storms, and disruptive rain patterns.\n\nMillions of people in impoverished Caribbean nations and territories such as Puerto Rico, Cuba, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic have been left without power or running water for weeks or months in the wake of devastating tropical cyclones.\n\nHaiti is still reeling after Tropical Storm Grace hit the island nation shortly after a major earthquake in August 2021—the back-to-back disasters killed nearly 2,000 people. \n\nAuthorities there have been accused of squandering billions in aid. According to a New York Times report published last year, starting in 2010, some $13 billion in foreign aid provided a lifeline for millions of Haitians following natural disasters but “also allowed corruption, violence, and political paralysis to go unchecked.”\n\nOnly a week after Fiona devastated Puerto Rico, Hurricane Ian struck Cuba causing a nationwide blackout and destroying tobacco plantations, an important source of income for the island. Efforts to make the country more climate resilient continue to be undermined by the ongoing embargo.\n\nIn a blog post published last year, Juan Declet-Barreto, a Senior Social Scientist for Climate Vulnerability at the Union of Concerned Scientists, noted that “islands and their people are more vulnerable to climate impacts than continental jurisdictions.

      "blog_post": " Sixteen municipalities in Puerto Rico filed a lawsuit claiming that major oil companies including Chevron, ExxonMobil, and Shell are financially responsible for the damage caused by Irma and Maria, two catastrophic hurricanes that pummeled the Caribbean island in 2017.\n\nThe class action lawsuit notes that according to the scientific consensus, fossil fuel emissions are to blame for the climate crisis that has increased the global average temperature by 1.2 degrees Celsius (2.2 degrees Fahrenheit). \n\nMuch of this additional heat has been absorbed by the oceans and warmer waters are leading to more destructive and wetter tropical storms that have devastated Caribbean nations in recent years. According to official data, Maria killed nearly 3,000 people in Puerto Rico and caused $107 billion in damages.1\n\n\"Puerto Rico was hit by the perfect storm and is the ultimate victim of global warming,\" said Marc Grossman, one of the attorneys representing the plaintiffs in a press release. \"This is an opportunity to finally get justice for all that Puerto Rico sacrificed in 2017.\"\n\nStates, cities, and counties in the U.S. have filed around 20 cases to hold fossil fuel companies accountable for the climate crisis. \n\nThese cases are similar to one another because they all claim that fossil fuel companies misled the public by promoting products that they knew were causing climate harm. However, the Puerto Rico lawsuit is unique because it is the first to include claims under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) and, as such, it was brought in federal court instead of a state court.\n\nPuerto Rico could potentially receive tens of billions if the case succeeds and a victory would set a precedent that would allow other jurisdictions to file RICO cases against fossil fuel companies.\n\nIt could take years for the case to unravel but a good omen is that it bears similarities with some of the RICO cases that were successfully brought against the tobacco industry in the past, said Korey Silverman-Roati, a climate law fellow at Columbia University’s Sabine Center for Climate Law.\n\n“There is a key parallel with the tobacco industry because the plaintiffs argue that this is an industrywide effort to convince the public that dangerous, harmful products are not dangerous, even though the industry knows that they're dangerous,” Silverman-Roati told Treehugger.\n\nOil companies are ultimately responsible for the climate destruction that Puerto Rico suffered in 2017, the lawsuit argues, because they marketed and sold fossil fuels that are causing global warming, even though they were aware of the dangers since at least the 1970s—independent media outlets such as Inside Climate News and Drilled have thoroughly reported on this decades-long deceit.

      "blog_post": "\n\nBack in the early days of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, we witnessed in some European circles a resurgence of calls for fracking fossil fuel exploration—with Liz Truss’ brief tenure as the U.K. Prime Minister leading to an equally brief moment when fracking seemed likely to get the green light once more. It seems, however, that cooler heads are mostly now prevailing.\n\nGermans are competing with each other to save energy. Current U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has banned fracking once again. And there appears to be a lot more recognition that the path to energy independence lies not in greater reliance on polluting commodity fuels, but rather in doubling down on efficiency, sufficiency, and renewables. \n\nIndeed, if the IEA’s Renewables 2022 Report is to be believed, the invasion of Ukraine may eventually be looked back on as an inflection point for our transition away from fossil fuels—with major policy initiatives across the U.S., China, and Europe leading to faster deployment of renewables. And, in the case of Europe at least, a significant reduction in demand for natural gas, oil, and coal.\n\nTo underscore how quickly this is all happening, the forecast growth of renewables is 30% higher than predictions from just one year ago. As a result of this step change, the report says, we should see renewables overtake coal as the world’s leading source of power by 2025.1 \n\nHere’s how the IEA’s Executive Director Fatih Birol describes the global significance: \n\n    “Renewables were already expanding quickly, but the global energy crisis has kicked them into an extraordinary new phase of even faster growth as countries seek to capitalise on their energy security benefits. The world is set to add as much renewable power in the next 5 years as it did in the previous 20 years.This is a clear example of how the current energy crisis can be a historic turning point towards a cleaner and more secure energy system. Renewables’ continued acceleration is critical to help keep the door open to limiting global warming to 1.5 °C.”\n\nNone of this is inevitable, of course. And more always needs to be done. While Europe’s gas storage facilities are currently pretty full—allaying immediate fears of Russian leverage over energy demand—we’re also hearing news from The Guardian that Germans haven’t quite achieved the government’s desired 20% cuts in consumption, leading to concerns that next winter may be harder than this one. The IEA itself says that a further 100 billion euros of clean energy investments are needed to help Europe resist Russian energy blackmail in 2023.2\n\nAnd while Britain’s conservative government has finally reversed its ridiculous blanket ban on onshore wind and solar—a policy move that was clearly designed to placate the climate-skeptic wing of the party—it has also decided to grant approval to a controversial new coal mine. \n\nThey giveth and they taketh away, I guess. \n\nBut the broad point still stands. We are deep in the midst of an energy transition that the laws of physics dictate will have to get us to net zero emissions within the next few decades. Nobody is arguing that we can stop all fossil fuel use tomorrow. But there does appear to be a growing recognition that pitting the goal of energy security against climate security is a disastrous false choice. \n\nMore importantly, this is a powerful, teachable moment about the pace at which we can change—if we choose to. Because let’s face it: Even the new, 30% higher growth predictions for renewables still represent a pace that doesn’t really match the depth of the crisis we face. So while I am delighted to see that this shift is happening, I am also going to continue pushing for more. \n\n    How fast could we go if the price of fossil fuels represented their true cost? \n    How much could we achieve if we listened to protesters and scientists, and finally stopped looking for new fossil fuels? \n    What more could be done if we shifted our understanding of what \"the good life\" really looks like, focusing on sufficiency and community abundance, rather than production and consumption at all costs? \n\nWe’ve just seen that things can change fast. Let’s change them faster. \n",

      "blog_post": " When it comes to small homes, shipping container housing seems like the option with the greatest potential to be distributed on a large scale. That's due in large part to their baked-in modularity, as they are made to be moved around easily when integrated into a global infrastructure system of ships, trucks, and cranes. They also come with a price tag that can be as low as several hundred dollars. From this standpoint, shipping container housing makes sense if you want to have lots of cheaper housing that can be shipped almost anywhere.\n\nOf course, there are downsides to shipping containers; they can be difficult to insulate properly, and the treated wooden floors are toxic and need to be swapped out if they are being converted for habitation. But when done right, shipping container homes can be quite beautiful and functional, despite these initial hurdles.\n\nComing out of Texas, Uncontained Dreams is one company that is designing and building some lovely homes out of shipping containers. The company's founder is Micah Woods—a former woodshop and metal shop teacher—who translated a lot of his knowledge into creating a high-end home that is both packed with features and affordable. We get a more in-depth look at the company's first model, The Rising Sun, via Exploring Alternatives:\n\nThe bespoke 40-foot-long home is inspired by Woods' love of Japanese architecture, putting the emphasis on clean lines and Japanese-style elements like the shou sugi ban trim around the windows and door—essentially lightly torched wood that is more resistant to pests and weathering. In addition, this home was built out of a high cube shipping container, which is one foot taller than a standard container, for a total of 9.5 feet.\nRising Sun shipping container house by Uncontained Dreams exterior\n\nExploring Alternatives\n\nTo boost interior ventilation and comfort, the home has a mini-split system for heating and cooling and plenty of operable windows to increase natural air circulation.\n\nInterestingly, Woods says that the company has developed a unique method of installing windows on the uneven exterior surfaces of the shipping container, which even DIYers could use:\n\n    \"I wanted to create a container that anyone could build, so we created a method that allows you to have no-weld [windows].

      "blog_post": "I started publishing content six months ago. I am by no means an influencer — I typically post 2–3 times per week — but I have learned a few things along the way.\n\nMy top 10 lessons from 6 months of writing online\nYou just have to do it. There is no practice run, you just have to hit publish. And then months later you look back and cringe a little. It’s all part of the process.\nNo one is paying attention at first. This feels protective and then frustrating because you want people to notice what you’re doing!\nSometimes you say something wrong and people tell you. Get over the defensive reflex, be gracious, and do better next time.\nLearn from people who have done it. There are plenty of systems and programs to follow. None are perfect, but it is better to start with a framework than a blank sheet of paper.\nPeople will unsubscribe from you. It stings the first few times. I tell myself it’s just a mismatch and not an indicator that I’m doing something wrong.\nYou have secret fans. These are some of my favorites. They never interact digitally but when you speak they say ‘that thing you published back in October really helped me’. What?! Amazing.\nPeople gravitate toward the ‘real stuff’. It’s the hardest to write, and the hardest to publish. Sharing pieces of your own story (in addition to thought leadership) makes a big impact.\nYou need a schedule. If you want to publish regularly, you need a system that keeps you consistent. Maybe it’s writing the content for an entire month in one day. Maybe it’s writing one day, and publishing the next. Figure out your strategy.\nYou will guess wrong about what’s going to be a hit. The things I think will be great end up flopping. The random thing I wrote quickly gets reposted dozens of times. I haven’t built a predictive algorithm yet :)\nIt can be so gratifying. This past week, I published something that had people saying ‘this is EXACTLY me’ and ‘I feel so seen’. That makes it all worth it.\nThanks, \nCarlos Caro\n for inspiring me to get this down on paper!\n\nChallenge 2: If you had to write something and publish it in two days (meaning, it has to be something you already know about) — what is the headline and who needs to read it?\n\nNow, what’s keeping you from taking that first step?\n\nAre you ready to bring more of yourself to your online presence? Connect with me on Linkedin and stay tuned this week for a quick and easy way to refresh your LinkedIn profile (and help someone who was impacted by layoffs).",

      "blog_post": "17 documented ways to use words to grow a movement of people who can’t get enough.\nOne of the most powerful skills you can learn, even in the video age, is to write with impact.\n\nBut the true effects of being a skilled writer are not felt until you can truly master your emotional effect on your reader.\n\nFor longevity in this craft, you want a loyal audience. You want your readers going to sleep thinking about your words, excited to read more.\n\nYou as a writer have the power to grow and lead vast communities – even movements.\n\nThrough years of writing in public, here’s what I’ve learned about making your readers fall in love with you:\n\nTell us the truth.\nMost people do not. They sugar-coat for fear of repercussions.\n\nThey are doing their audience a disservice by telling half-truths, or watered-down ideas with the intention to impress, over truly helping them.\n\nServe the people who need it most, by giving it to them straight.\n\nHave a sense of humour.\nEven more ‘serious’ topics can benefit from appropriate humour.\n\nI’m telling you – please – use humour more often. There are far too many writers who are unintentionally boring because they’re just. so. serious. Be different. Bring out YOUR quirky sense of humour.\n\nBe funny – at least occasionally.\n\nShow us who you really are.\nA huge moment for me in my writing career was when I finally saw my writing not only as a means to convey ideas but as an opportunity to reveal the depth of my character.\n\nYou can’t paint a picture of yourself without both the lighter AND darker shades. Be willing to be real as F.\n\nYou will stand out like the Mona Lisa.\n\nBe more conversational.\nMany of us are used to the dry approach of school textbooks or newspaper articles.\n\nThis will not help your reader create a bond with you, the author. Be loose and your humanity will flow out and touch another. This holds enormous appeal to those sick and tired of robotic, dry and ultimately inauthentic language.\n\nWrite like you’re talking to someone for whom you care deeply.\nAn interesting thing happens when you see your reader in a new light.\n\nThey are not faceless morons who you see as merely a statistic.\n\nWhat would happen to your writing if you no longer saw your reader as an ‘average Joe,’ but rather someone you wanted the absolute best for?\n\nInspire us to see what’s possible.\nDo this with examples, vivid imagery, case studies, and stories of personal transformation.\n\nWhen you can inspire them to see what they themselves are capable of, they will grow very attached to your writing.\n\nWrite about what few agree with you on.\nWriting is about provoking the status quo, not maintaining it. Be bold, and go where few agree.\n\nAll is subjective. No one thing is ever totally the ‘right’ thing. Be the writer who is in the minority – most people will respect your stance.\n\nIf you aren’t attracting a few haters, it’s a sign you’re too vanilla.\n\nUse your own nerves as a gauge.\nJames Altucher says he doesn’t hit ‘publish’ on most of his articles unless he feels nervous.\n\nHe has built a tremendous following using this ‘strategy,’ choosing uncomfortable topics that don’t always put him in the most graceful light. He writes about his shyness, his failures, and his tougher moments.\n\nHe also regularly shares strong opinions – like how college is a waste of money – all of which create a loyal, yet polarised readership.\n\nWrite when you are angry.\nIf you’re not angry think of something that makes your blood boil. This is an occasional option, obviously.\n\nI can assure you this will not only give you the energy to write with passion, but it will translate in many cases to a highly enjoyable read.\n\nTell us about the time you struggled the most.\nPeople are thirsty for stories about another human’s hardship.\n\nThey see themselves in your shoes, and get emotional about it, especially when your story shines a light to the possibility of victory.\n\nTell us about what you learned from a highly emotional experience.\nIf it was emotional for you, it’s likely to be profound for the reader when you convey the lessons learned.\n\nReturn to those moments, and allow the emotional rush to add flavour to your words.\n\nReveal something you’ve been hiding.\nYou’ve been hiding it for a reason. It holds a lot of meaning for you.\n\nWhat secrets are you willing to share that the world needs from you?\n\nWrite from your soul.\nIn other words, write without trying hard. Let your inner wisdom take over when you write freely and calmly.\n\nIf it takes ten minutes of free writing absolute nonsense beforehand – great. Your reader needs you to do this.\n\nShow us what has worked.\nTheory is one thing, but nothing strikes a chord quite like sharing real-world examples of what has worked for you and your clients, for example.\n\nPeople want to see ideas put to use. This will inspire them to enact your ideas in their own lives.\n\nSave us time and hardship.\nShow us how you went through pain so we don’t have to.\n\nMaking their lives easier will garner you respect and more readers, so remind us frequently when you’ve done the hard work, or had the tough experiences. This will carve you into the shape of a leader people look up to.\n\nGive us more than we expect.\nWhether a LinkedIn post or a book chapter, every piece you write would benefit massively through being unexpected. When the reader gets more than they expected, they can’t help but want more of the same ‘service’ from you.\n\nThis is how to make your reader feel like a VIP.\n\nWrite what others refuse to write.\nRegularly bring your consciousness to what others are writing about in your niche for example.\n\nWhat is often missed? This applies to both topics, but also in writing strategies.\n\nHOW could you write, and in what quantities, that few others are doing?\n\nNow get out there and write.\n\n–",

      "blog_post": "Have you thought about the concept of marinating? I mean really thought about it?\n\nConsider the fact that you can throw a bunch of ingredients together in a bowl or bag — even kind of artlessly if you want to — then add your chicken, your meat, your beans, whatever; and magically, as you go about your day (or, even as you sleep!), whatever is soaking in that marinade is just getting better and better. You are doing exactly zero work, and yet, your dinner is getting more tender, more flavorful, more ready to cook. I’m sorry, but that’s awesome.\n\nGrilling chicken gets a bad rap for drying out on the grates, but, with a little help from that marinade, can be the best thing at the barbecue. Here’s how:\n\nmarinated chicken grilled\n\nStep 1: Choose Your Marinade (see below). Then, in a medium bowl, whisk or blend together all ingredients. Add to a Ziploc bag a glass, ceramic or metal container, along with chicken (either thighs or breasts that have been pounded to even thickness, or sliced in half horizontally). Marinate in the fridge for 8 to 24 hours, flipping a few times if you can.\n\nStep 2: Grill. When you are ready to cook, heat a grill to medium-high, and brush with a tiny bit of olive oil. Let any excess marinade drip off the chicken before you place on the grill. Depending on thickness, grill pieces about 5-6 minutes total (a little longer for thighs), flipping halfway, until chicken is firm but not rock hard to the touch.\n\nMarinade 1: Lemon-Herb\nThis is my back-pocket marinade because I always have what I need to make it. The secret is the mayo, which serves to lock in the moisture of the chicken.\n\n2 tablespoons mayo\n1/4 cup olive oil\nsqueeze of honey (not too much)\n2 teaspoons Dijon mustard\nkosher salt and freshly ground black pepper\n2 cloves garlic, peeled and halved\njuice from half a lemon\nfresh rosemary, thyme, or torn basil leaves (or a combo)\n\nMarinade 2: Vietnamese-Style Marinade\nI’ve made Andrea Nguyen’s traditional Shaking Beef recipe (from Vietnamese Any Day) too many times to count, mostly because the marinade is so flavorful — sweet, salty and funky. Lucky for us, those same ingredients work with chicken, too. Here’s my slight adaptation.\n\n1 1/2 tablespoons oyster sauce\n2 teaspoons soy sauce\npinch sugar\n1 1/2 teaspoons fish sauce\nfreshly ground black pepper\n2 garlic cloves, smashed\ndash of sesame oil\n1/4 cup neutral oil\n\n\nMarinade 3: Yogurt-Herby Marinade\nThe difference with this one is that you need to process all the ingredients in a blender, then set aside about a 1/4 cup of the marinade (before you add chicken), so you can use it as a dip for serving later. (Just store in fridge.) Feel free to play around with the spice — I like garam masala, but sometimes swap in curry powder or loads of freshly ground black pepper. The key here is the yogurt, which breaks the chicken down and gives it an excellent tang.\n\n2 cups plain whole-milk yogurt\n1 cup coarsely chopped fresh cilantro leaves and stems\n1/2 large onion (coarsely chopped)\n1/3 cup olive oil\n4 garlic cloves (peeled) coarsely chopped\njuice from one juicy lime\n1 tablespoon garam masala\n1 2-inch piece fresh ginger (peeled and chopped) kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper\n\nWhat are your favorite marinades? Please share.",

      "blog_post": "“Clean coal” was once, for some, a promising way to reduce toxic pollutants and carbon emissions in coal production when better options were costlier and less widely available. For others, “clean coal” has always been an oxymoron. Today, new technologies promise to make coal cleaner—yet no matter how “clean” coal becomes, it will still be dirtier, costlier, and less renewable than wind, solar, and other truly clean sources of energy.\nThe Rise of Dirty Coal\nCoal has been at the heart of the industrial age since James Watt perfected the steam engine in 1776. By 1850, nearly all (98%) of Great Britain's energy was provided by coal, as Britain became the workshop of the world.1 The United States soon followed suit: By 1900, 71% of America's energy came from coal, but not without cost.2\n\nAccording to the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration, there were 104,895 fatalities from coal mining and other coal-related activities in the United States between 1900 and 2020.3 Coal also fueled the 19th-century growth of cloth factories, which increased the demand for Southern cotton and, in turn, quadrupled the number of enslaved people in the United States.4\n\nYoung boys at work at the troughs used for cleaning coal at a pit in Bargoed, South Wales.\n“Cleaning coal” used to mean picking out impurities or foreign objects by hand.\nTopical Press Agency / Getty Images\n\nBurning coal releases soot, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury, and a number of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) harmful to plants and animals alike.5 Coal is the most carbon-dense of all fossil fuels, which is why burning it makes it by far the dirtiest, releasing more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere by mass than any other fuel.67\n\nAccording to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, coal represents only 12% of all energy consumption in the United States, yet it produces 21% of energy-related CO2 emissions. In the electricity sector, coal produces 58% of all CO2 emissions, despite producing only 26% of the U.S.'s electricity.8\n\nGlobally, burning coal accounts for 29% of all energy-related greenhouse gas emissions, larger than any other single source.9 Cleaning up coal would go a long way toward improving human health and reaching the climate goals of the Paris Agreement. Eliminating coal altogether would do even more.\n\nThe Emergence of “Clean Coal”\nEfforts to create cleaner coal technology arose in an era when coal was by far the single largest source of the world's energy but also when concerns about coal burning were focused on acid rain rather than global warming.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Energy started its Clean Coal Technology Demonstration Program in 1986, with a goal to reduce emissions of particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides, key contributors to acid rain. The programs innovations are credited with reducing NOx emissions from coal plants by 82%, SOx emissions by 88%, and particulate matter emissions by 96%, even as coal use increased by 183% between 1970 and 2008.10\nIn the 2010s, the meaning of “clean coal” changed to include addressing CO2 emissions after the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency declared carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases pollutants in 2009, and especially when the Obama Administration launched its Climate Action Plan, shifting the focus of the Clean Coal Technology Program to carbon capture, use, and storage (CCUS).11 It is now called the Office of Clean Coal and Carbon Management to emphasize the role that carbon capture plays in the program.\nCoal Embraces Carbon Capture\nAlong with the oil and gas sectors, leaders of the world's coal industry promote “high efficiency, low emissions” (HELE) coal plants with carbon capture technologies as ways to continue burning fossil fuels in a carbon-neutral manner.\n\nThe Hazelwood coal plant in Australia, for example, long called one of the world's most polluting coal-fired power station, was scheduled to be decommissioned in 2009 because of its high CO2 emissions, but the plant was able to postpone its closure until 2031 by beginning a carbon capture and storage pilot program, extracting CO2 from its smokestacks and turning it into calcium carbonate.12\n\nBut faced with rising costs and competition from natural gas and renewable energy sources, the Hazelwood plant closed in 2016. In July 2021, developers proposed a wind farm overlooking the closed coal plant. Still today, the promise of \"clean coal\" has yet to bear fruit.\n\nThe Hazelwood coal fired power station in the Latrobe Valley, Victoria, Australia\nEven CCUS couldn't save the Hazelwood coal plant.\nAshley Cooper/Construction Photography/Avalon/Getty Images\n\nThe International Energy Agency's Energy Technology Perspectives 2020 described carbon capture and storage as “the only group of technologies that contributes both to reducing emissions in key sectors directly and to removing CO2 to balance emissions that cannot be avoided.” The key to CCUS is to make it cost-effective. As the IEA's report notes, “markets alone will not turn CCUS into the clean energy success story it must become,” which is why both the U.S. administration and the European Union are committed to helping bring costs down.13\n\nAs with other areas in clean energy, government support might allow initially costly technologies to become mature and efficient enough to be marketable. Without that economic viability, “clean coal” is indeed an uneconomical contradiction in terms.\n\nCoal Death Watch\nIn order to meet the goals of the Paris Climate Accord, coal will need to fall by an annual rate of 11% every year until 2030. Recent projections estimate that 89% of available coal must remain in the ground if we are to have a 50% chance of reaching the target of remaining under 1.5 degrees C warming.14 CCUS will need to play a role in the attempt to keep from overheating the planet, but it will need to do so without keeping coal plants alive.\nWhile advanced industrial nations continue to move away from coal, it remains an affordable source of energy for many developing economies. It still provides 33.8% of the world's electricity—the largest single source, according to the nonprofit campaign Ember's Global Electricity Review 2021.\n\nYet global coal generation is falling. China was the sole country in the world to expand its coal production in 2020—by 2%. Worldwide, coal production fell by 4% in 2020, while wind and solar together expanded by 15%.15\n\nWind turbines spin to produce electricity as steam rises from cooling towers at Jaenschwalde, Germany.\nIn Germany, renewable energy made coal mining unprofitable even before coal subsidies were cut in 2018.\nSean Gallup/Getty Images\n\nIn the United States, coal production peaked in 2008 and continues to decline.16 In April 2019, renewable energy sources produced more electricity than coal for the first time.17 It now costs more to keep many an existing coal plant running than it is to install a new solar power plant.18 And once installed, solar energy has near-zero marginal costs (it costs nearly nothing to operate), meaning it out-competes coal in energy markets.\n\nThis is why 80% of coal plants in the United States are either slated to retire by 2025 or are uneconomical compared to local wind and solar resources. Add the cost of CCUS—still uneconomical on its own—and the days of coal (clean or not) are numbered.",

He walked into a shop, purchased the cheapest toaster he could find, and promptly went home and broke it down piece by piece.\n\nThwaites had assumed the toaster would be a relatively simple machine. By the time he was finished deconstructing it, however, there were more than 400 components laid out on his floor. The toaster contained over 100 different materials with three of the primary ones being plastic, nickel, and steel.\n\nHe decided to create the steel components first. After discovering that iron ore was required to make steel, Thwaites called up an iron mine in his region and asked if they would let him use some for the project.\n\nSurprisingly, they agreed.\nThe Toaster Project\nThe victory was short-lived.\n\nWhen it came time to create the plastic case for his toaster, Thwaites realized he would need crude oil to make the plastic. This time, he called up BP and asked if they would fly him out to an oil rig and lend him some oil for the project. They immediately refused. It seems oil companies aren’t nearly as generous as iron mines.\n\nThwaites had to settle for collecting plastic scraps and melting them into the shape of his toaster case. This is not as easy as it sounds. The homemade toaster ended up looking more like a melted cake than a kitchen appliance.\n\nThis pattern continued for the entire span of The Toaster Project. It was nearly impossible to move forward without the help of some previous process. To create the nickel components, for example, he had to resort to melting old coins. He would later say, “I realized that if you started absolutely from scratch you could easily spend your life making a toaster.”\n\nThe Toaster Project by Thomas Thwaites (How Innovative Ideas Arise)\nThomas Thwaites set out to build a toaster from scratch. The Toaster Project, as it came to be known, ended up looking more like a melted cake. (Photo Credit: Daniel Alexander.)\nDon’t Start From Scratch\nStarting from scratch is usually a bad idea.\n\nToo often, we assume innovative ideas and meaningful changes require a blank slate. When business projects fail, we say things like, “Let’s go back to the drawing board.” When we consider the habits we would like to change, we think, “I just need a fresh start.” However, creative progress is rarely the result of throwing out all previous ideas and innovations and completely re-imagining of the world.\n\nConsider an example from nature:\n\nSome experts believe the feathers of birds evolved from reptilian scales. Through the forces of evolution, scales gradually became small feathers, which were used for warmth and insulation at first. Eventually, these small fluffs developed into larger feathers capable of flight.\n\nThere wasn’t a magical moment when the animal kingdom said, “Let’s start from scratch and create an animal that can fly.” The development of flying birds was a gradual process of iterating and expanding upon ideas that already worked.\n\nThe process of human flight followed a similar path. We typically credit Orville and Wilbur Wright as the inventors of modern flight. However, we seldom discuss the aviation pioneers who preceded them like Otto Lilienthal, Samuel Langley, and Octave Chanute. The Wright brothers learned from and built upon the work of these people during their quest to create the world’s first flying machine.\n\nThe most creative innovations are often new combinations of old ideas. Innovative thinkers don’t create, they connect. Furthermore, the most effective way to make progress is usually by making 1 percent improvements to what already works rather than breaking down the whole system and starting over.\n\nIterate, Don’t Originate\nThe Toaster Project is an example of how we often fail to notice the complexity of our modern world. When you buy a toaster, you don’t think about everything that has to happen before it appears in the store. You aren’t aware of the iron being carved out of the mountain or the oil being drawn up from the earth.\n\nWe are mostly blind to the remarkable interconnectedness of things. This is important to understand because in a complex world it is hard to see which forces are working for you as well as which forces are working against you. Similar to buying a toaster, we tend to focus on the final product and fail to recognize the many processes leading up to it.\n\nWhen you are dealing with a complex problem, it is usually better to build upon what already works. Any idea that is currently working has passed a lot of tests. Old ideas are a secret weapon because they have already managed to survive in a complex world.\n\nIterate, don’t originate.",

      "blog_post": "Do you really need that specialized power tool forever or just for the day? Should you invest in a full set of camping equipment, even if you’re not sure your family will enjoy it? Isn’t there someone out there who wants to trade those size 8 ice skates for a size 9?\nIf you ever find yourself pondering questions like this, welcome to collaborative consumption—a concept of organized sharing and swapping. Although peer-to-peer sharing may have been a tenet in communities of lore, our modern this-is-mine culture has taken us away from what seems like such practical common sense. But the times, they are a-changin’.\n\nPrivately-held clothing and book swaps have become a very practical social pastime among friends, but now the premise is spreading into more official capacities. Sites and services are popping up to facilitate the simple concept: You can get what you need without buying it. The arrangements are manifested in a number of ways.\n\nThere are sites that help to connect people with stuff to lend to people who wish to borrow. Some places, like Yoodlize, arrange rentals; some create swaps, while others create communities of sharers. And there's no shortage of creativity. Take, for example, Shared Earth, which connects people who have land with people who want to garden or farm.\n\nMany mega-retailers have rental options, think AutoZone for specialty auto-repair tools or Home Depot for tool rental. Chances are your local hardware store has rental options as well.\n\nMany of the apps and websites come and go, and many are based on specific communities. So look around and see what you can find. Even using something like Facebook Marketplace for buying and selling used items will allow the seller to not add something to the landfill and the buyer to not purchase a new item to eventually add to the waste stream.\n\nSwap party. Event for exchange of clothes, shoes, accessories. Reduce and reuse\nfotoksa / Getty Images\nWith a little research, you can find pretty much anything; of course, there's AirBnB, but there are also places like Turo for cars and HomeExchange for vacation houses. You can also use this idea at the very local level; start or participate in a little free library or a little free pantry, initiate a clothing swap in your neighborhood, or approach a neighbor about swapping some of your lemon bumper crop with their obvious zucchini surplus.\n\n 6 Steps to Hosting a Successful Clothing Swap\nIt’s a brilliant model of sustainability—no new stuff to clutter the landfill, yay! But there is a beneficial emotional aspect as well. Not only in community-building but in that the lending element requires trust, and being trusted feels good. Paul Zak, founding director of the Center for Neuroeconomics Studies at Claremont Graduate University, has shown that people get a spike of the pleasant neurotransmitter oxytocin when they’re entrusted with another person’s goods. “We’re gregariously social creatures, and one way we can exhibit that sociability is by sharing our things,” he says.\nCollaborative consumption is at once so simple yet so revolutionary. It replaces “beg, steal, and borrow” with “lend, share, and swap.” It’s sustainable, the sense of community feels great, and that little rush of oxytocin doesn’t hurt either.",

      "blog_post": "In this article, I’d like to share 30 “one-sentence stories” about building better habits. (They are not all exactly one sentence, but they are very short.)\n\nNone of these stories are mine. They were sent to me by readers of Atomic Habits. My hope is that these examples will illustrate how real people are putting the book into practice. They will show you what people are actually doing to build good habits and break bad ones. And hopefully, they will spark some ideas for how you can do the same.\n\nI have divided the stories into categories that roughly correspond to different sections or ideas in the book.\nIdentity-based habits\nOne of the central ideas in the book is the concept of building “identity-based habits”, which essentially recommends focusing on the type of person you wish to become rather than the outcome you wish to achieve.\n\nOne reader named Roland used the idea to improve his eating habits.\n\n“I stopped eating unhealthy food via identity change,” he wrote. “I tried many times in the past, but it became easy — natural — only after I had made the conscious decision that I want to be someone who eats healthy. Instead of aiming for I want to stop eating bad food, I tried changing the mindset to I am someone that eats healthy and lives a healthy life. It changes how you approach things.”\n\nAnother reader named Robert employed this idea to help him quit smoking. He wrote, “I recently stopped smoking and the difference between I don’t smoke and I can’t smoke is a powerful trainer of my brain. The positive message of I don’t smoke is that I have not “given up” anything. I am not sacrificing a pleasure. I am investing in my future happiness and wellbeing.”\n\nLike most strategies in the book, the concept of identity-based habits can be combined with other habit building tactics. For instance, one reader used an external reward of $10 to reinforce the desired identity. “I told myself, I am no longer a drinker. Then, after each day of non-drinking, I gave myself $10 to buy something nice rather than poison (like clothes and household items). Today, I no longer need the allowance and I’m six years sober.”\n\nChapter 2 of Atomic Habits covers these strategies in much greater detail.\n\nChanging the Cues\nAnother way you can change a habit is by identifying and altering the cues that prompt your behavior. This is precisely what many readers have done.\n\nOne woman named Lisa cultivated a reading habit by increasing her exposure to books. “I’ve read more books by continually having 20-30 books on hold at the library,” she said. “It saves time on browsing for books. I always have new things to read with a three-week deadline.”\n\nHeather used a similar strategy to reinforce the simple habit of drinking more water. “I use color and placement for visual reminding and motivation. I poured water in a bright aqua water bottle – my favorite color – and placed it on my nightstand so I couldn’t miss it when I woke up.”\n\nOther readers have done the opposite. They reduced exposure to negative cues. One man named Max managed to eliminate his e-cigarette habit. “I quit e-cigarettes with a combination of determination and also quitting coffee at the same time, which was a trigger for me as I’d smoke and drink coffee together in the morning.”\n\nHabit Stacking\nAnother popular tactic in the book is something I call “habit stacking.” It’s strategy I first learned from Stanford professor B.J. Fogg. He refers to it as “anchoring” because you anchor—or stack—your new habit onto a current habit.\n\nOne reader used habit stacking to create a simple rule for learning a new language.\n\n“When I first moved to China and started to learn Mandarin, I committed to strike up a conversation with the taxi driver whenever I went into a cab (I took a lot of cab rides, 5+ daily). I did it for 2 years no matter the time of day or how tired I was. I now speak fluent Chinese.”\n\nSimilarly, a reader named David told me, “I meditate for 20 minutes after brushing my teeth in the morning. Linking new habits onto a keystone one seems to work.”\n\nYou’ll find all sorts of habit stacking examples in Chapter 5 of Atomic Habits.\n\nEnvironment Design, Part I\nI have written about the power of the environment and the importance of choice architecture in the past. The simple truth is our environment often shapes our behavior. Many readers are using this fact to their benefit by installing some of the environment design strategies I share in the book.\n\nFor starters, you can break a bad habit by increasing the friction in your environment.\n\nOne woman named Cyd curtailed her snacking habit with the following strategy. “My husband still loves his Pringles, as do I, but they’re now kept in a locked car that’s parked in the cold. It works!”\n\nMultiple readers are learning to wake up earlier.\n\nOne reader named Daniel told me, “I jump out of bed every morning without any hesitation. The reason? The only way to turn off my alarm is to scan a QR Code I keep in the bathroom. This worked wonders for me.”\n\nChris utilized both environment design and habit stacking to stop sleeping in. He wrote, “I have a bad habit: Hitting snooze. To eliminate it, I “made it hard” and put phone in the bathroom. The phone then became a habit stack. The first thing I do when I wake up: turn off alarm, go to bathroom, brush teeth, etc.”\n\nOne of my favorite examples was sent to me by J. Money, the personal finance blogger. He wrote, “I brush my teeth right after putting my kids to bed every night (8pm), which has prevented me from eating or drinking (alcohol) at night for years… ‘Cuz who wants to re-brush them again!”\n\nIt’s a great example of creating just enough friction to keep your bad habits at bay.\n\nEnvironment Design, Part II\nTypically, we think of designing physical spaces, but you can use the same principles to shape your digital environment as well. For instance, a reader named Matthew wrote to me and said, “I significantly cut down on mindless Instagram time. Simply logging out of the app makes a big difference.”\n\nAnother reader named Viet went even further. “I used my own laziness to my own advantage with my bad habit of browsing Facebook. Deleting Facebook and having to go through the one extra step of going to website and logging in manually was enough barrier for me to not get back on.”\n\nAnd Rahul did something similar to kill his video game habit. “For gaming addiction, I removed my graphic card,” he wrote. “For excessive net surfing on mobile, I uninstalled apps and removed the Chrome browser.”\n\nEnvironment Design, Part III\nOn the flip side, you can foster good habits by reducing the friction in your environment.\n\nNatalie started picking up her cluttered clothes and building better cleaning habits simply by reducing the number of steps between her and the laundry basket. “I quit leaving my socks all over the floor by putting a little basket beside the door to collect them in.”\n\nSimilar strategies can be particularly useful for building new exercise habits.\n\nOne reader named Justin sent me the following message: “I started going to a gym that was less than a mile from my house. This took away the time and inconvenience excuses. I was never consistent at exercise, but now I work out 8-10x a week. Crossfit, running, and cycling. I’ve been going strong for 2.5 years.”\n\nAnother reader wrote, “I’ve been running at 6 A.M. for the past two years. I always put my running gear (Garmin, compression sleeves, shoes, etc.) into a neat pile the night before. When I get up, I just get dressed and go out the door.”\n\nI’ve even heard from readers who go to sleep wearing their running clothes. All they have to do is stumble out the door in the morning.\n\nFor more on environment design, see Chapters 6 and 12 of Atomic Habits.\n\nHabit Substitution\nIn many cases, it can be more effective to replace your bad habit than to merely try to eliminate it.\n\nThe beautiful thing about habit substitution is that you can build a good habit and break a bad one at the same time. One reader told me, “At home I would go out to my backyard to smoke, so I put a weight bench out there and every time I wanted to smoke I’d go out and do some reps instead. After that, my craving was reduced.”\n\nI thought the following idea was interesting. One reader replaced biting their nails with cutting their nails. “I stopped biting my fingernails mostly by making sure clippers were always close at hand – especially at work.”\n\nMany readers have substituted a new habit in a “stair step” fashion. They gradually shift from the old habit to something healthier.\n\nMark, for example, shared the following strategy. “I significantly cut back on beer consumption. I used flavored sparkling water to replace the beer and I asked my wife to stop having beer in the fridge for a while. Once I replaced the habit (it was mostly stress drinking after work), I was able to add beer back into my life.”\n\nAnd another reader, also named Marc, curtailed his drinking in a similar way. “I replaced drinking beer every day in a succession of replacements, going through fruit juice, then iced tea, then seltzer water. I did it over about nine months by having one less drink a week. Once I finally quit, I got past the cravings in only two weeks. I haven’t had a drink in over a year now.”\n\nShawn used this approach to stop smoking. “I decided to quit smoking and used a fun-sized Snickers candy bar as a substitute until the major cravings went away. I’m still smoke-free years later.”\n\nSubstitution can even be useful in a broader sense. Suraj wrote, “I was addicted to drugs and alcohol. To beat my addiction, I started working out. Now I am planning to compete in powerlifting meets.”\n\nTo a certain degree, habit substitution allows you to look for a healthier obsession. Some people are hooked on alcohol. Others are hooked on exercise. Either one can be unhealthy if taken too far, but generally speaking it’s a lot better to spend a few hours exercising each day than to spend a few hours drinking each day.\n\nMindset Tricks\nSometimes I like to employ clever little mental tricks to stick with a good habit.\n\nOne reader named Caelan wrote, “I quit smoking by assigning my cheat days progressively farther in the future. I never quit “for good,” I only quit until my next cheat day. This helped with cravings, because the choice wasn’t between “right now” or “never,” it was “right now” or “later.”\n\nKen applied a similar strategy to his habit of eating fast food. “I started small when I quit bad habits like eating McDonalds all the time and drinking soda. I told myself I’d take a week off, then said two weeks. That continued. This month, I made it four years without McDonalds and 15 months without soda.”\n\nAnother person used the Pointing-and-Calling strategy I discussed in Chapter 4. They wrote, “I quit smoking by saying a mantra out loud every time I wanted a cigarette (“your brain tricks you”) which I think changed my thinking from the subconscious part of my brain to the logical part.”\n\nQiana used a little math and a clever visual trick. “I stopped drinking soda,” she wrote. “I added up all the sodas I drank for the week and counted how many tablespoons of sugar were in those soda cans and bottles. I began to scoop the amount of sugar into an enormous bowl The visual did it for me. I had to break that habit.”\n\nHabit Tracking\nFinally, I’d like to close with one of my favorite strategies: habit tracking.\n\nHere’s how a few readers are using it…\n\nCindy sent me an email saying, “I purchased a large wall calendar and started building the chains. This really works for me. I like to build that chain. There are 6 months of red X’s on my calendar. I am healthier, have lost 30 pounds, feel stronger, exercise more, garden, read more, work on my small business, and practice my French.”\n\nThe easiest way to start tracking your habits is to use the templates provided in the Habit Journal. It will make the whole process a breeze.\n\nMy favorite approach is to pick a very tiny version of your habit and track that. For example, I have been tracking the habit of “reading 1 page” for the last month. One reader named Günter did something similar. “I’ve done a simple workout every day for over half a year now. I managed to stick to it by changing the scope: when I don’t have time for a full set or don’t feel like it, instead of skipping altogether, I do an abbreviated session. I also mark it in my calendar.”\n\nHopefully, these short stories give you some ideas on how to build better habits in your own life. If you’d like to learn more about the strategies discussed above, check out Atomic Habits. And if you’re interested in a notebook that makes it easier to build better habits, try the Habit Journal.\n\nBut no matter what, keep taking action in small ways each day. It is so gratifying for me to see people making real changes in their life because of these ideas. As always, thanks for reading.",

      "blog_post": "Most people, who want to start coding, don’t know how and where to start. Most of the time they even don’t know, which programming language to learn first. Right now I have experiences in HTML, CSS, PHP, JAVA, C++, Python and R. In this story I will tell you how I started.\n\nHow it begun\nNearly two years ago one of my teachers asked me to join the schools homepage-team. The purpose of the team was to administrate (and also develop) the schools homepage. At this time there was only one programmer, who really code something. The others added articles to our homepage, so they didn’t need any programming skills. At this point I have to admit that I had no programming skills as well.\n\nBecause our ‘senior’ programmer hadn’t really time, I had to learn everything from scratch on my own — quite hard and the same situation many readers of this story might be in as well.\n\nWeb Development\nI was so excited and so started a research in the web on ‘how to learn web development’. I knew that I had to learn HTML and CSS, but that was all. The result of my research was this great website, where I’ve learned HTML5 and CSS3 (german). This tutorial was the origin of several websites I build (not dynamically, of course). I really created a website for everything: Summarizing the stuff I had to learn for my next english exam, a website containing all information about projects we made and several others.\n\nAfter some time I met the senior programmer of our homepage-team again and he told me to learn PHP, so that I can create dynamic websites like the homepage of our school. Again I made researches to find websites like the previous one and to learn how to use PHP. Unfortunately I didn’t find such a good website and had to collect my knowledge from every site I found. It didn’t worked as well as learning HTML /CSS and so I was pretty fast on a kind of plateau: I did not really understand what I was doing and how the code worked.\n\nSo I asked the only programmer I knew so far and he made me a great offer: Let’s remake the homepage based on a new framework: CodeIgniter. We worked through the summer holidays 2015 reshaping the whole website. In these six weeks I gained my major knowledge of PHP and Web Development!\n\nNow I was able to build dynamic websites based on CodeIgniter and learned my first ‘real’ programming language (plus a little JavaScript).\n\nLearning C++\nHowever some day I thought: ‘I want to create real applications!’ Of course Web Development is really important and exciting, because you really SEE what you have made and don’t have ‘only’ a console application.\n\nNevertheless I wanted to create my own Windows application and bought a book about C++ (I can really recommend it!). It was hard, because I wasn’t quick on the uptake like I was when I learned PHP. And here is the important thing I’ve learned during the learning time of C++:\n\nNever give up and keep learning by practising!\n\nFurther Languages\nAfter learning those languages (PHP, C++) it was easy for me to adopt further languages like JAVA and Python, because once you have the knowledge, how everything works, the only thing that changes is the syntax (and of course some specific things that makes the language unique and worthable to learn).\n\nAdditional Tips and Remarks\nAs mentioned above: Never stop practising. However sometimes you are tired of learning more about a specific programming language. If you come to this point, learn a new one and some day you will be full of pleasure if you restart coding the language you’ve learned before.\n\nIf you find something you really want to learn: Do it!\n\nSome weeks ago I read a tweet about R, a programming language which is perfect if you want to do some analytics. I was really interested in analytics and wanted to practise it a little bit, because this time I got tired of coding in C++. Right now I’m learning more about analytics in R and enjoy the time really well.\n\nPractise together\n\nIf you have some friends enjoying coding like you do, ask them to collaborate on a certain project you all are interested in. It’s much easier to fix problems.\n\nGoogle is your friend and so all communities.\n\nIf you have a problem, you are not able to fix, surf the web to find a solution to your problem. It’s likely that someone asked the same question you have in a community like StackOverflow. If not: ask your question in an appropriate forum.\n\nI hope this story helped you and the decision on how to start coding isn’t as difficult for you as before. I always searched for someone writing about how he had begun and so I wanted to do it to help others on their journey of coding.\n\nIf this story helped you, feel free to like it, share it or to leave a comment.\n\nAlso feel free to have a look at my GitHub account (didn’t upload many of my projects, because I just used it to collaborate with others) or to send me a message on Twitter.\n\nHave a great day and keep coding!",

Ultimately, you’ll have the best results by tweaking any idea you have of your own, but we also wanted to provide some short story ideas to help you get started.\n\nHere are 20 short story ideas to take your writing to the next level:\n\nYour character opens the mailbox to find their biggest fear inside.\nAfter a devastating fall, your character is learning the hardships of healing after an accident.\nCharacter accidentally insults their company’s CEO – right before a big promotion.\nThe character lost a child years ago but lives as if it just happened the day before.\nYour character’s village wise woman tells the story of how magic was lost due to abuse.\nYour character lives in a space pod traveling space, and they’re also claustrophobic.\nAsh floated from the mountaintop and awoke your character from their night’s sleep.\nYour character hasn’t eaten in days and stumbles upon real berries, and so does a starving bear.\nWhen your character’s heart is broken, they must find a way to heal it – any way.\nYour character is an orphaned 7-year-old who hears voices.\nYour character just found out they have a rare disease…that hasn’t been detected anywhere in centuries.\nAfter a fight with their ex, your character decides to go on a trip to the neighboring town that hosts very…unusual tales.\nYour character accidentally runs into the wrong person on the street…and now they can’t sleep at night.\nWhen your character moves schools, they didn’t expect to find a secret lurking throughout the school…that all the teachers know about.\nIt’s your character’s turn in their culture’s ritual of fighting a lion barehanded. They’ve never been good in fights.\nAfter extreme weather conditions plague your character’s town, they finally leave home to find everybody has gone missing.\nYour character is in the back of an ambulance, trying desperately to revive someone who’s apparently dead…so why are they still away and breathing?\nAfter a short stint at a hospital as a nurse, your character decides to take their skills to the mountains as a wilderness medical professional. They just didn’t expect to find odd and interesting injuries among campers.\nAn apple appears at your character’s front door every morning and they can’t figure out who’s putting it there.\nWhen an avalanche quakes the mountains in your character’s town, it unveils something that’s been hidden for…millenia.\nSometimes short story ideas are enough but if you want to utilize them effectively, keep these tips in mind:\n\nKeep it simple and focus on a single portion of a character’s life\nMake sure the reader has a clear picture of your main character right away\nFocus on the theme and message you’re trying to get across\nLet the short story idea create a life of its own\nBe unique and think of many possible endings to the story before outlining your story\nStep 2 – Focus on Character Development\nIn order for a short story to be impactful, you have to know your character well. Character building is essential in short stories since your main characters often drive the story.\n\nYou only have a certain amount of time to show your readers who that person is and you can’t do that if you don’t even know who they are.\n\nThink about it.\n\nIf you write a short story about your best friend, whom you’ve known for many years, versus writing one about someone you just met yesterday, you’ll be able to craft a much stronger story about your best friend because you know them so well. Creative writing techniques can help you bring out the best or most compelling things about your characters.\n\nThe same goes for your fictional characters.\n\nBut when writing a short story, you won’t have the same type of character arc as you would when writing a novel.\n\nYou don’t have to spend a ton of time on your main character, but know their history, age, personality, family life, friend life, love life, and other details that shape the way someone sees the world.\n\nKeep in mind that since your short story is, well, shorter than a novel, you may remove a few steps. Knowing the overall character journey, however, can be helpful for your main character development within short stories.\n\nSpend enough time on character development when you’re learning how to write a short story or improving your creative writing skills will pay off by introducing your readers to memorable characters.\n\nStep 3 – Outline\nThankfully, the outlining process for short stories is much easier than a full novel, but I do still advise creating one in order to have a cohesive flow throughout the story.\n\nThis is definitely useful for those of you who prefer outlining versus just writing by the seat of your pants.\n\nThe point of view you’ll use\nHow you’ll start the story\nHow you’ll get from the beginning to the main issue\nWhat happens at the “climax” (yes, even short stories have one!)\nResolution of the main issue\nThe very end\nKeep in mind that the art of how to write a short story can close with something that ends very abruptly or you can flesh it out until there’s a satisfying ending.\n\nThis is really up to you as an author to decide. Practicing this for short stories can help you create an outline for your book, too.\n\nStep 4 – Start with something out of the ordinary\nIn order to hook readers from the start of your story, you should write an opening scene that’ll catch someone’s attention right off the bat.\n\nHere’s what that looks like at the start of the short story:\n\nShort Story Opening Example:\nHow To Write A Short Story - Opening Example\nOdd? Yes. Attention-grabbing? You bet! This is how to write a short story with an opening that gets readers engaged, invested in your character, and motivated to read the entire story.\n\nBecause we’re automatically intrigued by the fact that people don’t normally go around collecting roadkill. It’s another place using creative writing examples can really help you draw in your readers in a short story.\n\nNow, you don’t have to start your short story with something as strange as that but you do want to give your readers a sense of who your character is by depicting something different right away that also has to do with the core focus of your short story.\n\nTake this short story called The Gift of the Magi by O. Henry, for example. This author starts with a very low money amount and then hits you with the fact that it’s Christmas the very next day.\n\nShort Story Opening Example\nThis is out of the ordinary because many readers understand that having such little money (scraped up money, at that) right before Christmas isn’t typical. It’s odd – and also hits their emotions right away.\n\nIf you want to learn how to write a short story, read the opening paragraphs of short stories. And pay attention to the many different ways writers hook readers.\n\nStep 5 – Get the first draft done ASAP\nDone is better than perfect. That’s the best way to approach the process of writing a short story or anything else. We’ve all heard or read these words time and time again – and that’s because they’re important; they’re true.\n\nThis is especially the case when it comes to short stories. Once you have your outline and know how to start writing, drafting the short story in full comes next.\n\nDon’t worry about editing or polishing the story up in any way right now. After all, you can’t possibly make good edits until you know what the story looks like in full. When you’re learning how to write a short story, resist the urge to get it perfect.\n\nThat would be like matching your earrings to your pants without first having the full outfit put together. You don’t know if those earrings work well with it until you see what else you’ll be wearing.\n\nIt’s the same for writing. Focus on getting your draft done so you can move on to the next step.\n\nThe process of how to write a short story is rarely one-and-done but usually takes writing, rewriting, and editing to create your best work.\n\nFind the BEST Publishing Path For Your Needs!  Take this 2-minute assessment to learn which of our publishing paths will be  the best for you and your unique needs as an aspiring author. Answers delivered  immediately!  TAKE THE ASSESSMENT!\n\nStep 6 – Edit your short story\nEditing is where the real magic happens when you’re learning how to write a short story. We all have this idea in our minds that we’ll get it perfect the first time and that’s just not how writing works.\n\nMost of the time, your first draft is just the bare bones of what’s to come but through line editing, developmental edits, and proofreading, it will transform into something better.\n\nThink of the actual writing as the wooden structure of a house and the editing as the drywall, paint, windows, light fixtures, doors, and anything else that’ll make the house complete.\n\nThese are a few things to keep an eye out for when editing your short story. The elements of story structure to look for include:\n\nPoint of view consistency\nTense consistency\nConsistency with the setting of your story\nWeak verbs (replace them with our list of strong verbs found right here!)\nShowing versus telling (readers need you to show more!)\nStronger imagery\nSpelling/grammar/dialogue\nIf you want to learn how to write a short story, editing is a necessary part of the process. So what’s that look like? The editing process for short stories is pretty much the same for novels.\n\nThe only difference is that short stories tend to focus more on imagery and exposition than they do full character and plot development.\n\nStep 7 – Title your story\nThis can be one of the most difficult things for any book, let alone a story that’s only a few hundred to a few thousand words.\n\nThe good news? Short story titles are a little less important than titles for novels. They can also be very abstract.\n\nWhat you want to think of when titling your short story is this:\n\nWhat’s the overarching theme?\nSomething unique about the story?\nSounds intriguing but not explanatory?\nWhat makes sense after reading the short story?\nWhat could be mysterious enough to be intriguing?\nThese questions will help you develop a title that not only makes sense but is also intriguing enough to pull readers in while staying true to what the story is about.\n\nIt’s also great practice to help you come up with titles when you write and publish your book.\n\nLearning how to write a short story includes learning how to write a great title or headline. And let’s face it, a great title or headline gets readers to pay attention. Put your creative writing skills to work here. Come up with a bunch of different titles, and ask our writing partners or target audience for feedback.\n\nStep 8 – Get feedback\nNo matter how experienced (or inexperienced) you are as a writer, you need feedback.\n\nTo create your best work, it’s just part of the process when you’re learning how to write a short story. I know…it can feel scary. But feedback from the right people will help you make your short story better.\n\nIn order to learn and improve and ensure your message is coming across as desired, you need someone else’s fresh eyes on it.\n\nGoogle Docs is a great option to write your short story and get feedback from others all in one place.\n\nWe need this help because the simple fact is, we’re too close to our writing.\n\nIt’s impossible to read your story with a critical eye when you’re the one who came up with and wrote it in the first place. That’s just we’re wired when we’re learning how to write a short story or anything else. We need feedback to improve.\n\nAllowing others to read your work and offer feedback is one of the best ways to improve and make sure your story is exactly how you want it. This is why writing partners and even beta readers are so important.\n\nStep 9 – Practice by writing short stories often\nThe number one best way to learn how to write good short stories is by writing them often.\n\nWhen you’re writing regularly, your brain falls into the habit of being creative and thinking in terms of short stories.\n\nIf you want to learn how to write a short story and get good at it…practice. The more you do it, the easier it will get and the more you’ll improve. So focus on writing a certain number of short stories per week and stick to that – even if they aren’t your favorite.\n\nStep 10 – Write one short story every day for 30 days\nThis is separate from writing short stories often. If you really want to kickstart your progress and get really good quickly, then create a challenge for yourself.\n\nWant to learn how to write a short story, get good at it, and write faster? Do this…\n\nWrite one short story, whether it’s 500 or 1,000 words, per day for an entire month.\n\nWhen you’re done, you’ll have 30 full short stories to review, edit, and improve upon. Doing this not only builds a habit, but it also give you a lot of experience quickly.\n\nAfter those 30 days, you’ll know more about how you like to write short stories, which mean more to you, and how to write them to be good. If you want to learn how to write a short story, give this challenge a try. Seriously, it’s just 30 days.\n\nStep 11 – Focus on a single message to share\nShort stories are known for being impactful even though they’re not novel-length.\n\nLearning how to write a short story forces you to think of ways to take your reader on a journey in a much shorter space than a book.\n\nAnd that means they have to have a core theme or message you want to get across. This can be anything from loving yourself to ignoring societal expectations.\n\nIn order to do this, think about what you want people to walk away from your story feeling.\n\nWhat is the desired outcome?\n\nIf you just want people to enjoy the story, that’s great. However, what makes a story impactful and enjoyable is what readers take away from it.\n\nBrainstorm some themes that are important to you and work your short story around them. When you understand how to write a short story this way, it will not only make you care about your story more (which means it’ll be written better), but it’ll also make it more satisfying for readers.\n\nStep 12 – Tie it up with a satisfying ending\nNobody likes a story that ends on a major cliffhanger.\n\nIt’s okay for your short story to have an unresolved ending. In fact, that’ll likely be the case simply because the story is…well, short.\n\nBut you do want to tie your story up in a way that leaves the reader feeling satisfied even if they didn’t get all the answers.\n\nMany times, this means circling back to an idea or element presented in the beginning. It’s one storytelling strategy of how to write a short story and wrap everything up.\n\nThis story structure often allows readers to feel as though they’ve read a complete story versus just a snippet of a larger one.\n\nWhy all writers should learn how to write a short story\nThere’s a lot more to writing short stories than you may think. As a short story writer, keep in mind that just because they’re shorter in length doesn’t mean it takes any less skill to execute a good one.\n\nShort story writers get this…Being able to tell a full story in such a short amount of time arguably takes more skill than writing a full-length novel or nonfiction book.\n\nThat being said, why is it beneficial for all writers to learn how to write a short story?\n\n1 – You learn the skill of showing\nShort story writers have a challenge that requires some patience to overcome, but it’s worth it. When you only have a few pages to hook readers, paint a clear picture of the main character, and tell a story, you end up mastering the skill of showing instead of telling.\n\nThe reason for this is because, in order to accomplish a successful and good short story, showing is a major part of that.\n\nIt’s far too difficult to write a great short story without showing the details and using strong verbs to paint a clear image of your main character’s life. Great short story writers understand the “show don’t tell” concept.\nIf you want to learn how to write a short story, getting clear on this will save you a lot of time.\n\nThose skills will transfer into anything you write, automatically making it that much better. One more reason is that learning how to write a short story will help with other writing projects.\n\n2 – You’ll strengthen individual chapters\nNo matter if you’re a fiction writer, short story writer, or if you prefer nonfiction, the idea here is the same.\n\nA chapter is basically a short story that’s a part of a bigger whole. The same skills you apply to write a great short story will also help you write stronger chapters.\n\nEach part of your book should be polished, strong, and enticing for your readers. Using short story writing methods will help you achieve that within your chapters.\n\nWhy is writing good chapters important if there’s a whole book available for someone to read?\n\nBecause it hooks readers and keeps them turning that page.\n\nAnd when readers look back on an entire book filled with incredible chapters, the entire book as a whole will be seen as being that much better. Spending time learning how to write a short story sets you up for success when you write your book or pursue other writing projects.\n\nHello, 5-star reviews!\n\n3 – It makes the story sections of your nonfiction book more captivating\nEvery nonfiction book has portions where stories must be told in order to get the point across.\n\nThis is what allows people to relate to you as an author, which pulls them in deeper and makes the core message of your book resonate with them more. It’s another part “how to write a short story” skills will help you connect with readers.\n\nBut if those stories are weak, not well-written, and lackluster, it’s unlikely someone will enjoy them as much.\n\nIt’s also likely that your message will get lost because the book doesn’t carry the same impact.\n\nKeeping readers engaged from start to finish can feel like a tall order. But when you learn how to write a short story with a beginning, middle, end, and a message readers will love you for it.\n\nFind the BEST Publishing Path For Your Needs!

TAKE THE ASSESSMENT!\n\nHow long are short stories?\nShort stories should remain below 7,000 words in order to be considered a “short story.” They can be as short as only one sentence, as this is known as flash fiction.\n\nYou already know that short stories are… shorter than your average novel but do they have any other differences?\n\nHere’s a chart detailing the main differences in how many words are in short stories, novels, novellas, and nonfiction works.\n\nType of writing\tWord count\tPages in a typical book\tExample\nShort story\t100 – 15,000\t1 – 24 pages\t“The Gift of the Magi” by O. Henry\nNovella\t30,000 – 60,000\t100 – 200 pages\t“A Clockwork Orange” by Anthony Burgess\nNovel\t60,000 – 100,000\t200 – 350 pages\t“Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone”: by JK Rowling\nEpic Novel\t120,00 – 220,000+\t400 – 750+ pages\t“Game of Thrones” by George R.R. Martin\nAs you can see, the main difference is length, but that’s not all. When you understand how to write a short story, you’re only writing a very impactful snippet of your main character’s otherwise full life.\n\nYou don’t have to unpack your entire character’s life story in a few hundred words in order to write a great short story.\n",

      "blog_post": "Houston, we have a problem.\n\nThe world generates 2.01 billion tonnes of municipal solid waste annually, with landfills groaning under the stress. We've delivered more than 170 trillion plastic particles to the oceans and continue to do so at an alarmingly rapid rate. With land and sea literally littered with trash, where else do we have to turn? Well, the final frontier, of course. Space.\n\nNASA calls what's known as low Earth orbit (LEO) an orbital space junkyard, explaining that \"most orbital debris comprises human-generated objects, such as pieces of spacecraft, tiny flecks of paint from a spacecraft, parts of rockets, satellites that are no longer working, or explosions of objects in orbit flying around in space at high speeds.\"\n\nThere are no international space laws to clean up debris in our LEO, says NASA, adding: \"LEO is now viewed as the World’s largest garbage dump, and it’s expensive to remove space debris from LEO because the problem of space junk is huge.\"\n\nJust how huge? Huge, and getting huger.\n\n\"The number of satellites in orbit is expected to increase from 9,000 today to over 60,000 by 2030, with estimates suggesting there are already more than 100 trillion untracked pieces of old satellites circling the planet,\" says a press statement from the University of Plymouth announcing a study in which a group of scientists is calling for a legally-binding treaty to ensure Earth’s orbit isn’t irreparably harmed by the future expansion of the global space industry.\n\nThe group of scientists is an international collaboration of experts in fields ranging from satellite technology to ocean plastic pollution. Hailing from a diverse range of institutions— including the University of Plymouth, Arribada Initiative, University of Texas at Austin, California Institute of Technology, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Spaceport Cornwall, and ZSL (Zoological Society of London)—they say we are in urgent need for global agreement on how best to oversee the Earth’s orbit.\n\nThey argue that while satellite technology provides a broad range of social and environmental benefits, if allowed to grow without governing, large parts of Earth’s orbit could become unusable.\n\n\"Satellites are vital to the health of our people, economies, security and Earth itself,\" says Melissa Quinn, head of Spaceport Cornwall. \"However, using space to benefit people and planet is at risk ... Humanity needs to take responsibility for our behaviours in space now, not later.\"\n\nWhile they recognize that a number of industries and countries are beginning to address satellite sustainability, they assert that such focus should be enforced for any nation that intends to use Earth’s orbit.\n\nThe study cites the dismal stewardship with which we've treated the ocean—\"where insubstantial governance has led to overfishing, habitat destruction, deep-sea mining exploration, and plastic pollution\"—as a harbinger of what's to come if we don't take action now.\n\n“I have spent most of my career working on the accumulation of plastic litter in the marine environment; the harm it can bring and the potential solutions,\" says Professor Richard Thompson OBE, head of the International Marine Litter Research Unit at the University of Plymouth. \"It is very clear that much of the pollution we see today could have been avoided. We were well aware of the issue of plastic pollution a decade ago, and had we acted then the quantity of plastic in our oceans might be half of what it is today.\"\n\n\"Going forward, we need to take a much more proactive stance to help safeguard the future of our planet,\" Thompson adds. \"There is much that can be learned from mistakes made in our oceans that is relevant to the accumulation of debris in space.”\nImportantly, they add that governance should include measures that make producers and users responsible for satellites and debris, from the time they launch onward. There is an easy argument to be made that this oversight is one of the most significant factors around our catastrophic plastic pollution problem. For example, the way in which beverage manufacturers shifted the responsibility of recycling single-use plastic to the consumer.\n\nAlso citing humanity's record with plastic pollution as instructive for what not to do, study leader Dr. Imogen Napper, says, “Now we are in a similar situation with the accumulation of space debris. Taking into consideration what we have learnt from the high seas, we can avoid making the same mistakes and work collectively to prevent a tragedy of the commons in space. Without a global agreement we could find ourselves on a similar path.”\n\nThe study, \"Protect Earth’s orbit: Avoid high seas mistakes,\" was published in the journal Science.",

      "blog_post": "Glow-in-the-dark animals? It may sound like science fiction, but they've been around for years. Cabbages that produce scorpion poison? It's been done. Oh, and the next time you need a vaccine, the doctor might just give you a banana.\n\nThese and many other genetically modified organisms exist today because their DNA has been altered and combined with other DNA to create an entirely new set of genes. Genetic engineering (also known as genetic modification) involves using laboratory-based technologies to alter the DNA sequence of an organism. This could mean changing a single base pair (which form the \"rungs\" of the DNA ladder), deleting a region of DNA, or adding a new segment of DNA. This may be done to transfer a desirable trait from one organism to another. As the National Human Genome Research Institute explains on its website, \"Used in research and industry, genetic engineering has been applied to the production of cancer therapies, brewing yeasts, genetically modified plants and livestock, and more.\"\n\nThere are different forms of genetic modification. For centuries, farmers have relied on traditional crop modification, by selectively breeding and cross-breeding plant and animal species based on the traits they wanted to see continue. Lab-based genetic engineering developed in the 1970s and copies desired traits from one organism in another. Genome editing (or CRISPR) is a newer method that's more precise and targeted at making changes to DNA sequences for altered outcomes; these could be aimed at changing physical traits like eye color or reducing disease risk. From the National Human Genome Research Institute: \"These technologies act like scissors, cutting the DNA at a specific spot. Then scientists can remove, add, or replace the DNA where it was cut.\"\n\nYou may not realize it, but many of these genetically modified organisms are already a part of your daily life—and your daily diet. In 2020, 92% of U.S. corn, 94% of soybeans, and 96% of cotton were genetically engineered. Many of these plants are used to make ingredients used in other products, which is why it's estimated that 60% to 70% of processed foods on grocery store shelves contain genetically engineered ingredients.\n\nHere’s a look at the some of the weirdest genetically engineered plants and animals already in existence—and many that are coming your way soon. Fortunately there are no humans in this list!\n\n1\nof 12\nGlow-in-the-Dark Animals\nscientist touches nose of pig bred to glow in the dark\nSAM YEH / Getty Images\n\nIn 2007, South Korean scientists altered a cat's DNA to make it glow in the dark and then took that DNA and cloned other cats from it, creating a set of fluffy, fluorescent felines. Here’s how they did it: The researchers took skin cells from Turkish Angora female cats and used a virus to insert genetic instructions for making red fluorescent protein. Then they put the gene-altered nuclei into the eggs for cloning, and the cloned embryos were implanted back into the donor cats—making the cats the surrogate mothers for their own clones.\n\nEarlier research in Taiwan created three pigs that glowed fluorescent green. That's Wu Shinn-chih, assistant professor for the Institute and Department of Animal Science and Technology of National Taiwan University (NTU), with one of the pigs in the photo.\n\nWhat's the point of creating a pet that doubles as a nightlight? Scientists say the ability to engineer animals with fluorescent proteins will enable them to artificially create animals with human genetic diseases.\n\n2\nof 12\nEnviropig\nmedium sized pink pig lays down in large pile of hay\nBloomberg Creative / Getty Images\n\nThe Enviropig, or \"Frankenswine,\" as critics call it, is a pig that's been genetically altered to better digest and process phosphorus. Pig manure is high in phytate, a form of phosphorus, so when farmers use the manure as fertilizer, the chemical enters the watershed and causes algae blooms that deplete oxygen in the water and kill marine life.\n\nSo scientists added an E. coli bacteria and mouse DNA to a pig embryo. This modification decreases a pig's phosphorous output by as much as 70%, making the pig more environmentally friendly.\n\n3\nof 12\nPollution-Fighting Plants\nrows and rows of yellow poplar trees with skinny white trunks\nOliver Strewe / Getty Images\n\nScientists at the University of Washington are engineering poplar trees that can clean up contamination sites by absorbing groundwater pollutants through their roots. The plants then break the pollutants down into harmless byproducts that are incorporated into their roots, stems and leaves or released into the air.\n\nIn laboratory tests, the transgenic plants are able to remove as much as 91% of trichloroethylene—the most common groundwater contaminant at U.S. Superfund sites—out of a liquid solution. Regular poplar plants removed just 3% of the contaminant.\n\n4\nof 12\nVenomous Cabbage\nwhole head of green cabbage covered in holes eaten by caterpillars\nChonticha Vatpongpee / Getty Images\n\nScientists have taken the gene that programs poison in scorpion tails and looked for ways to combine it with cabbage. Why would they want to create venomous cabbage? To limit pesticide use while still preventing caterpillars from damaging cabbage crops. These genetically modified cabbages would produce scorpion poison that kills caterpillars when they bite leaves—but the toxin is modified so it isn’t harmful to humans.\n\n5\nof 12\nWeb-Spinning Goats\nwhite small goat with tiny horns stands outside farm with grass\nShotPrime / Getty Images\n\nStrong, flexible spider silk is one of the most valuable materials in nature, and it could be used to make an array of products—from artificial ligaments to parachute cords—if we could just produce it on a commercial scale. In 2000, Nexia Biotechnologies announced it had the answer: a goat that produced spiders' web protein in its milk.\n\nResearchers inserted a spiders’ dragline silk gene into the goats’ DNA in such a way that the goats would make the silk protein only in their milk. This \"silk milk\" could then be used to manufacture a web-like material called Biosteel.\n\n6\nof 12\nFast-Growing Salmon\natlantic salmon swimming in river surrounded by tiny particles\nWestend61 / Getty Images\n\n\nAquaBounty's genetically modified salmon grows twice as fast as the conventional variety. The company says the fish has the same flavor, texture, color and odor as a regular salmon, and can help address overfishing problems. However, the debate continues over whether the fish is safe to eat or good for the environment.\n\nGenetically engineered Atlantic salmon has an added growth hormone from a Chinook salmon that allows the fish to produce growth hormone year-round. Scientists were able to keep the hormone active by using a gene from an eel-like fish called an ocean pout, which acts as an \"on switch\" for the hormone.\n\nSome opponents are concerned that if this fish were ever to escape or be introduced into ecosystems, it might be about outcompete native species and become invasive.\n\nThe FDA approved the sale of the salmon in the U.S. in 2015, marking the first time a genetically modified animal was approved for sale in the U.S.\n\n7\nof 12\n'Flavr Savr' Tomato\nyoung male scientist inspects gmo tomatoes in greenhouse lab\nLonghua Liao / Treehugger\n\nThe Flavr Savr tomato was the first commercially grown genetically engineered food to be granted a license for human consumption. By adding an antisense gene, the California-based company Calgene hoped to slow the ripening process of the tomato to prevent softening and rotting, while allowing the tomato to retain its natural flavor and color.\n\nThe FDA approved the Flavr Savr in 1994; however, the tomatoes were so delicate that they were difficult to transport, and they were off the market by 1997. On top of production and shipping problems, the tomatoes were also reported to have a very bland taste: \"The Flavr Savr tomatoes didn’t taste that good because of the variety from which they were developed. There was very little flavor to save,\" said Christ Watkins, a horticulture professor at Cornell University.\n\n8\nof 12\nBanana Vaccines\na large bunch of green bananas ripening on tree in jungle\nondacaracola photography / Getty Images\n\nPeople may soon be getting vaccinated for diseases like hepatitis B and cholera by simply taking a bite of banana. Researchers have successfully engineered bananas, potatoes, lettuce, carrots and tobacco to produce vaccines, but they say bananas are the ideal production and delivery vehicle.\n\nWhen an altered form of a virus is injected into a banana sapling, the virus' genetic material quickly becomes a permanent part of the plant's cells. As the plant grows, its cells produce the virus proteins—but not the infectious part of the virus. When people eat a bite of a genetically engineered banana, which is full of virus proteins, their immune systems build up antibodies to fight the disease—just like a traditional vaccine.\n\n9\nof 12\nLess Flatulent Cows\nbrown cow with nose covered in wet grass eats on field with friends\nAndre Wilms / Getty Images\n\nCows produce significant amounts of methane as a result of their digestion process; it’s produced by a bacterium that’s a byproduct of cows’ high-cellulosic diets that include grass and hay. Methane is a major contributor—second only to carbon dioxide—to the greenhouse effect, so scientists have been working to genetically engineer a cow that produces less methane.\n\nAgriculture research scientists at the University of Alberta have identified the bacterium responsible for producing methane and designed a line of cattle that creates 25% less methane than the average cow.\n\n10\nof 12\nGenetically Modified Trees\ngroup of yellow loblolly pines circled around natural lake\nDouglas Sacha / Getty Images\n\nTrees are being genetically altered to grow faster, yield better wood and even detect biological attacks. Proponents of genetically engineered trees say biotechnology can help reverse deforestation while satisfying demand for wood and paper products. For example, Australian eucalyptus trees have been altered to withstand freezing temperatures, and loblolly pines have been created with less lignin, the substance that gives trees their rigidity.\n\nHowever, critics argue that not enough is known about designer trees’ effect on their natural surroundings—they could spread their genes to natural trees or increase wildfire risk, among other drawbacks. Still, the USDA gave approval in May 2010 for ArborGen, a biotechnology company, to begin field trials for 260,000 trees in seven southern states.\n\n11\nof 12\nMedicinal Eggs\nclose up of white chicken eggs in carton\nAntonio KrÃ¤mer / Getty Images\n\nBritish scientists have created a breed of genetically modified hens that produce cancer-fighting medicines in their eggs. The animals have had human genes added to their DNA so that human proteins are secreted into the whites of their eggs, along with complex medicinal proteins similar to drugs used to treat skin cancer and other diseases.\n\nWhat exactly do these disease-fighting eggs contain? The hens lay eggs that have miR24, a molecule with potential for treating malignant melanoma and arthritis, and human interferon b-1a, an antiviral drug that resembles modern treatments for multiple sclerosis.\n\n12\nof 12\nSuper Carbon-Capturing Plants\ngreen Switchgrass ( panicum virgatum ) with sunny haze\nVaivirga / Getty Images\n\nHumans add about nine gigatons of carbon to the atmosphere annually, and plants and trees absorb about five of those gigatons. The remaining carbon contributes to the greenhouse effect and global warming, but scientists are working to create genetically engineered plants and trees that are optimized for capturing this excess carbon.\n\nCarbon can spend decades housed in the leaves, branches, seeds and flowers of plants; however, carbon allocated to a plant’s roots can spend centuries there. Therefore, researchers hope to create bioenergy crops with large root systems that can capture and store carbon underground. Scientists are currently working to genetically modify perennials like switchgrass and miscanthus because of their extensive root systems.",

      "blog_post": "Awhile back I started writing on Medium to document my journey to becoming a software engineer. I had read countless twitter posts and articles saying it was imperative to my success as an aspiring software engineer. If I just documented my learnings it would give me exposure and someone would magically reach out and hand me a job! Needless to say the few articles I wrote and numerous twitter interactions were not fruitful. I didn’t end up sticking with it throughout my journey, which looking back, was probably for the best. I am sure this method has worked for some people but I learned quickly that it was not for me. As someone learning a new skill, your knowledge base is constantly evolving. Things you thought were correct yesterday you would laugh at ever having believed in today. It led me to question how good the information was that I was putting out there into the world which is why I ultimately stopped.\n\nHowever, I have been working as a software engineer professionally for the past 2 years and I finally feel confident enough to share a list of tips that, looking back, certainly helped along the way. Just a quick timeline on my career so far for those who are unaware:\n\n2019: Zero coding experience. Brand new to all things tech\n2020: Started applying to entry-level software engineering jobs all over the United States\n2021: Finally, after hundreds (and I mean HUNDREDS!), of applications I got my first junior software engineering job halfway across the country in Chicago.\n2022: Received a job offer for a senior software engineering position at a fin-tech company 11 months after starting my first professional software engineering job.\nI have had the highest of highs and the lowest of lows along this journey and I feel like if I had someone to tell me the things I am going to write about in this article I could have kept the lows a little higher and stayed a bit more positive along the way. Without further ado, here are the 5 most important tips I learned on my software engineering journey so far!\n\nTip #1: A degree is not necessary, but it certainly helps.\n\nI cannot tell you how many jobs I would have an initial interview for where the recruiter says they think I would be a great fit but the company just won’t budge on their degree requirements. This is not to say you cannot get a job in tech without a degree. I am proof that you can. This is to say however, if you are considering going to school anyway or are halfway through, it might not be the worst idea to go ahead and get that degree.\n\nTip #2: You don’t have to ‘build a social media presence’ to land the job.\n\nI want to reiterate that I have no problem with people doing this. If you enjoy it then more power to you! However, I have never actually met someone that got their first job through a social media contact. I would often read things that say it is the most important thing to do when trying to break into the tech world and I personally haven’t seen the data to back that claim up. It takes a lot of time to do correctly and build relationships and in most cases I think that time would be better spent actually learning or making connections with recruiters at companies.\n\nTip #3: Make connections with someone at the company you are applying to.\n\nI spent so much time filling out those really long applications when I started applying to jobs only to never hear back from anybody. If you are using LinkedIn (which I think is the best place to be for job seekers) then find the job poster or a recruiter at the company and make a connection with them. You’d be surprised at how quickly you will get responses because not everyone thinks to do this. I will be writing an in depth article on my process for doing this that got me over 90% of my interviews in a post later this week so be sure to follow if you are interested in learning more!\n\nTip #4: Absolutely utilize the LinkedIn quick apply.\n\nNow I know that this is quite literally the opposite of the tip above but let me explain. I was told time and time again “Don’t even bother with the quick apply feature it all goes right in the garbage”. So I ignored it almost the entire time I was applying. You may notice I said almost the entire time. That’s because I was feeling lazy one day and decided to just hit the quick apply option after hundreds of applications and as you can now probably guess by my tone, clicking that button resulted in me getting my first software engineering job. Sometimes it just pays to be lazy I guess! But seriously, it takes 20 seconds to drop your resume in the quick apply there is no reason not to be using it. Just don’t rely on it.\n\nTip #5: Nobody has ever not given up and not gotten a job.\n\nThis may be the least useful and most useful tip at the same time. Don’t ever give up. I have friends that got a job offer on their very first application. I know people who were like me and were on the application grind for about a year before getting that offer. A lot of it really is just being in the right place at the right time. Just know that if you are putting in the work and truly making your best effort that your time will come. I do not know anybody that has stayed consistent, put in the time, and has not gotten a job within a couple of years. So when things seem impossible and you’re ready to give up, just keep pushing!\n\nI know these tips would have changed my life during my learning/application process and if you feel as though they could change yours start up a conversation in the comments below. I would love to hear from you! Also make sure to follow me for more stories like this and let me know what topics you would like me to write about next!",

      "blog_post": "As soon as I sit down to write, I feel compelled to scrub my bathtub and reorganize my filing cabinet — the most tedious chores suddenly become more appealing than the task at hand. Writing can feel so daunting that we’ve invented the term writer’s block to describe the unique sensation of its challenge, and we debate whether the ability to write well is learned or simply innate. The work requires long stretches of intense focus and undivided attention, and doing it well usually involves a prolonged process of revision. For many of us, writing feels like one of the most burdensome activities we can do.\n\nGenerative AI tools like ChatGPT offer the seductive possibility that we can optimize this laborious process. But while it can clearly optimize the time and effort of writing, ChatGPT cannot necessarily optimize writing quality. The program produces highly competent prose that usually passes as human-generated, but so far, the quality of its writing — beyond the novelty of being authored by an algorithm — is mostly unremarkable. \n\nAt the University of California, Los Angeles, where I teach writing, the common sentiment among faculty is: “Sure, ChatGPT can write — but it can’t write well.” Some professors caution students against using the tool by appealing to their egos: “You could use AI to cheat on your essay, but do you really want a C+?” \n\nOthers, recognizing that AI tools will characterize the working world into which students will graduate, are beginning to allow their use in constrained ways, framing them as automated writing tutors or advanced grammar-checking tools. But even AI enthusiasts tend to advise students to maintain authorial control by editing any AI-generated output for accuracy, style and sophistication. \n\nThe flat, conventional feel that characterizes most AI-generated writing stems from the predictive nature of the algorithm. Trained on vast databases of human texts, from books to articles to internet content, programs such as ChatGPT, Bard, Bing, and Claude function like sophisticated autocomplete tools, identifying and predicting phrase patterns, which makes their output feel somewhat predictable, too. \n\nBut does predictable writing necessarily mean bad writing? When we talk about good writing, what exactly do we mean? As we explore new applications for large language models and consider how well they can optimize our communication, AI challenges us to reflect on the qualities we truly value in our prose. How do we measure the caliber of writing, and how well does AI perform?\n\nIn school, we learn that good writing is clear, concise and grammatically correct — but surely, it has other qualities, too. Perhaps the best writing also innovates in form and content; or perhaps it evokes an emotional response in its readers; or maybe it employs virtuosic syntax and sophisticated diction. Perhaps good writing just has an ineffable spark, an aliveness, a know-it-when-you-see-it quality. Or maybe good writing projects a strong sense of voice. \n\nBut then, what makes a strong voice, and why does ChatGPT’s voice so often fall flat?\n\nThe Value Of Human Error\n“The Elements of Style,” the classic reference book on writing by William Strunk Jr. and E.B. White, lays out a series of concrete rules. To write well, the authors say, you should abide by certain conventions, such as grouping your sentences into single-topic paragraphs. You should adhere to certain grammatical rules, like, “Do not join independent clauses by a comma.” You should “omit needless words” and write in an efficient, organized, streamlined manner. \n\nThese rules take effort for any human writer — we all miss the occasional comma splice, use a few more words than necessary or bury our main point in the middle of a paragraph. ChatGPT, by comparison, rarely makes rhetorical moves that stray from Strunk and White’s conventions unless instructed to do so, and the speed with which it spews forth efficient, grammatically correct sentences is impressive, unsettling and perhaps mildly humiliating to us error-prone human writers. For teachers trying to catch cheating students, the total absence of typos and grammatical flubs is often what raises suspicions. \n\nWe seem to tolerate and even expect a certain amount of idiosyncrasy in our writing, and the conventions themselves can be murky and variable— the Oxford comma, for instance, maintains a devoted cult of enthusiasts even while some style guides discourage its use, and languages like African American Vernacular English have their own coherent grammatical structures that differ from those of so-called standard American English. Conventions can also evolve over time — we now commonly treat “they” as a singular pronoun when a short time ago it was exclusively plural.\n\n“As we explore new applications for large language models and consider how well they can optimize our communication, AI challenges us to reflect on the qualities we truly value in our prose.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nWriting that consistently adheres to convention is effective because its predictability makes it easy to read. If you expect to find the main point of a paragraph in its opening, you can read faster than if you had to spend time hunting for it.\n\nBut simply abiding by the rules doesn’t make excellent writing — it makes conventional, unremarkable writing, the kind usually found in business reports, policy memos and research articles. In his review of AI-generated novel “Death of an Author,” Dwight Garner describes the prose as having “the crabwise gait of a Wikipedia entry.” Even when a user prompts ChatGPT to include specific grammatical errors or to stray from certain norms, its writing tends to carry a certain flatness. By design, the program relapses to a rhetorical median, its deviations mechanical whereas ours are organic.  \n\nThat’s not to say that convention flattens prose. In fact, convention lies at the root of much of the best writing — it’s rare to see acclaimed texts that stray dramatically from grammatical and stylistic norms. \n\nStructural convention also underlies much of what we call good writing. Most prize-winning literature innovates within classic story arcs: Aristotle’s three-act structure (beginning, middle and end); Freytag’s five-stage structure (exposition, rising action, climax, falling action and resolution); or a screenwriter’s six categories of dramatic conflict (conflict with self; with others; with society; with nature; with the supernatural; and with the machine).\n\nIndeed, the fact that AI, which is trained to detect and replicate underlying patterns in our writing, can produce such coherent prose is a testament to just how much we rely on convention, both at the sentence and structural level. \n\nExperimental works that abandon traditional narrative structures can be critically successful but tend not to receive popular readership — for instance, Jon Fosse’s “Septology,” a seven-volume, 800-plus page novel written as a single sentence, was a finalist last year for the International Booker Prize and the National Book Award but has only a few reviews to date on Amazon. We tend to admire writing whose predominant feature is experimentalism, but readability seems to matter to us, too — how great can a piece of writing be if few have the capacity or inclination to finish it?  \n\nUsing formulaic elements to produce language doesn’t necessarily mean the writing will sound formulaic — in fact, constraints can be useful creative tools. The Oulipo poets use formulas to innovate in their writing, applying algorithms like “snowball” (increasing each line length by one word), “lipogram” (avoiding words that use specifics letters), and “n+7” (replacing every noun in a text with the noun appearing seven entries away in the dictionary) to generate writing that often feels surprising and fresh. \n\nOddly, ChatGPT is not very good at producing writing under Oulipian constraints — it failed to generate correct responses to all of these formulas. In response to my prompt, “Write a sentence that doesn’t use any words containing the letter “E,” it wrote:\n\nSure! Here’s a sentence without the letter “E”:\n\n“The big brown dog ran swiftly through the grassy field.” \n\nIn this sentence, none of the words contain the letter “e.”\n\nThe overly enthusiastic “Sure!” and the affirmatory closing line make this sample feel like it was written by a mischievous child hoping the reader won’t notice that three out of the ten words in the sentence use “E”. Whatever limited sense of spark this passage has can be attributed to the AI’s failure to adhere to the constraint, to the human-like energy that comes from its error.\n\nThe student essay is another form of constraint. To earn a passing grade, writers must conform to its rules, but to excel they must innovate within and beyond them. Students must use specific citation methods, adhere to conventions of academic writing and ensure their responses fully address a prompt’s question; at the same time, they must offer sufficiently interesting variations on the theme, evidence of original thought and dynamic phrasing that commands attention — a delicate balance most do not consistently achieve. \n\nOccasionally, students surprise me with an unexpected idea or turn of phrase, but more often I’m struck by the similarity of their ideas and voices. And, of course, their writing is similar: They learn a standard high school curriculum. They’re mostly the same age, at the same place in life, with similar life experiences and challenges. They’ve been programmed with the same data and they’re responding to the same prompts.\n\n“Even when a user prompts ChatGPT to include specific grammatical errors or to stray from certain norms, its writing tends to carry a certain flatness.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nReading a batch of undergraduate essays is not unlike commanding ChatGPT to “regenerate” its response to the same prompt in new words — the program is eerily skilled at saying the same thing in countless new ways. Like students, it can meet the basic requirements of generic essay prompts but struggles to innovate beyond them; to walk the line between predictability and surprise; to keep one foot inside the box and the other outside it; to move from a C+ to an A+.\n\nBroadly, good writing seems to require a balance of conformity and nonconformity, and at times, deliberate rule-breaking. A certain amount of Strunk and White-style convention is necessary to convey ideas coherently — after all, language is a shared system of meaning, and straying too far from its rules risks losing connection with readers or becoming unreadable altogether. \n\nBut good writers recognize that grammatical rules are dictated by problematic power structures and are not independent measures of correctness. Good writers assess the rhetorical context for their writing and make deliberate decisions about where to conform and where to stray. \n\nThe opening line of Charles Dickens’ “A Tale of Two Cities” is a horrifically long, repetitive sentence, but deliberately so:\n\nIt was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way — in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.\n\nThe unwieldy length and repetitive nature of the sentence is its point. Its cascade of contradictory clauses violates most basic writing advice, and its flagrant comma splices override Strunk and White’s rules. But these moves mirror the meaning of the sentence and establish rhythmic momentum, allowing Dickens to characterize the period as a chaotic, contradictory, overflowing moment through both the phrasing of the language and its meaning. \n\nLiterature and writing courses teach the art of “close reading,” or looking to sentence-level elements like punctuation, diction and syntax, for insight into the deeper meaning of the text. Perhaps a key criterion of good writing is that which rewards close reading with rich congruity between syntax and story — in other words, writing with intention.\n\nI teach my students to understand writing conventions well enough to stray from them in deliberate, nuanced, powerful ways. ChatGPT can understand grammatical conventions, imitate them and break them on command. But because it has no intention, it can’t be purposeful in how it adheres to or strays from the rules. Its arguments are built not from critical thought, but from predictive phrase sequences — it doesn’t “know” what its passages are really about, only that their words tend to occur together, so it lacks the meta-cognitive awareness needed to selectively break the norms of composition to add layers of meaning. \n\nWhen I command ChatGPT to “Write the opening to a novel set in the current moment using a series of repeated clauses,” it writes:\n\nIn the midst of chaos, where uncertainty lurked around every corner, where hope and despair danced an intricate tango, where time seemed both fluid and stagnant, a new chapter began. A chapter etched with the echoes of a pandemic that had reshaped the very fabric of our lives, where masks adorned faces like silent guardians, where distance became the bitter mediator between loved ones, where solitude embraced us with its relentless grip.\n\nThe result isn’t terrible, but it has an overly familiar feel; the “new chapter” and “fabric of our lives” are tired phrases, and the repetition is not as musical or energetic as the Dickens opening. Elevating the writing with textual layers and nuanced opportunities for close reading would take word-by-word human editing.\n\n“ChatGPT can understand grammatical conventions, imitate them and break them on command. But because it has no intention, it can’t be purposeful in how it adheres to or strays from the rules.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nWriters who use AI as a drafting tool might be seen as intentionality remixers, drawing copy from ChatGPT as raw material and weaving purpose into the syntax and language. But so far, the chatbot on its own, or even with the support of savvy prompt engineering, does not excel at this particular task.\n\nMaking Intentional Choices\nBeyond simply deciding whether to adhere to convention, good writers make countless subtle rhetorical choices. What accounts for these choices — why is one iteration of a sentence better than another that says the same thing with slightly different diction, punctuation or structure? \n\nThe seeming subjectivity of the answer is at the root of what frustrates many students about graded writing assignments and most folks who compose things more intensive than a Slack message — but the subjectivity is the point. \n\nHow we measure successful writing changes depending on what the writer is trying to accomplish, and good writers are flexible enough to adapt to different scenarios. They make intentional decisions around three elements: audience, purpose and context. Who am I writing for, to what end and in what circumstance? Answering these questions can offer guidance on, for instance, when to use a particular word rather than its synonym. \n\nConsider the Dickens sentence above: If the author were writing for an audience of children rather than adults, he might have used simpler sentence structures; if he were writing an op-ed meant to persuade rather than a novel meant to entertain, he might have avoided the antitheses; and if he were writing a novel in 2023 rather than 1859, he might have used a different cadence and register.\n\nIt’s difficult to determine a text’s quality without considering the context in which it was written. In an ambitious attempt to create a universal measure of good writing, regardless of discipline or genre, the American Association of Colleges and Universities (AAC&U) developed a rubric whose categories focus on intentionality. It rewards writing that demonstrates “control” over syntax and mechanics; “attention” (but not necessarily blind adherence) to genre and disciplinary conventions; and “a thorough understanding of context, audience, and purpose that is responsive to the assigned task(s) and focuses all elements of the work.” \n\nIn other words, good writing isn’t about sophisticated sentences or complex ideas; it’s about unifying all elements into a coherent whole. You can write a poignant, lyrical, oblique sonnet about the rain, but if your purpose is to inform newspaper readers about the weather forecast, that’s not good writing.\n\nChatGPT produces weaker writing when it hasn’t received instructions about audience, purpose, and context, and must “decide” for itself what they are. Its writing improves as a user gives it more information about who it’s writing for, why and in what situation. But as these elements get more specific, it becomes harder to tell ChatGPT enough for it to generate an adequately tailored response. \n\nThe chatbot can write passable essays for standardized tests because the purpose and context are so general — they need to be for humans to produce texts that can be compared and ranked in an equitable way. \n\nBut in a highly specific context like a novel or a letter, ChatGPT can’t know enough to create sufficient nuance. Writing a prompt with all relevant information would be nearly impossible, and suboptimal for a technology meant to optimize our time. For creative, expressive, or exploratory writing tasks, using ChatGPT is like supervising a bumbling assistant who needs painfully detailed, step-by-step instructions that take more effort to explain than to simply do the work yourself.\n\nPinning Down Voice\nWe often say that good writing has a strong sense of voice. Speaking voices can be recognized from their tone and pitch, but what rhetorical features define a writer’s voice on the page? \n\nI sometimes ask students to underline selections from their drafts that they believe represent their voice. Sometimes they notice patterns or tics, stylistic quirks, a repeated word or sentence structure. Some highlight sections in which they convey strong opinions or a particularly well-defined point of view. Sometimes they label whole drafts as their voice — after all, they wrote it. \n\nOthers cannot find their voice at all — it was a class assignment, so they were writing in the voice of their academic alter-ego. Those who lack confidence sometimes point to grammatical errors as examples of their voice. Their wide-ranging answers showcase how difficult it is to pin down what makes a distinctive voice.\n\n“For creative, expressive, or exploratory writing tasks, using ChatGPT is like supervising a bumbling assistant who needs painfully detailed, step-by-step instructions that take more effort to explain than to simply do the work yourself.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nIt’s a complex equation that’s impossible to catalogue definitively: Voice manifests as degrees along the scales of rhetorical and stylistic qualities — whether the register is more on the formal or informal side; whether sentences are long and varied or short and repetitive; whether the diction is simplistic or sophisticated. \n\nVoice also comes through in the specific balance of scene and exposition, discourse and metadiscourse and in the specific argumentative angles the writer tends to take. To complicate things further, a writer can have many voices at once — a novelist who writes in the first person, channeling their narrator’s voice, is often still recognizable even through the mask.\n\nCan ChatGPT teach us anything about what makes writing sound like one person versus another? The program is a masterful ventriloquist — its ability to imitate style is one of its most impressive and delightful features. It does so by using “unsupervised learning” to detect rhetorical patterns from its massive database of various kinds of writing, without being told what to look for.\n\nThe frustrating part is that it can’t tell us precisely what it notices — it can only deliver text that imitates these patterns, often with startling aptness. It can write recognizably in the voice of any number of characters, real or imagined, historic or contemporary, from Oprah to Jane Austen, Holden Caulfield to Matthew McConaughey, and can emulate the style of texts from the Bible to a Fox News comments section to a wedding toast. \n\nWhen I input the prompt, “Write a speech about potatoes in the style of Donald Trump,” ChatGPT’s response sounds like the script from a “Saturday Night Live” sketch: “Folks, let me tell you, nobody loves potatoes more than me, believe me. I’ve been eating them my whole life. Best thing you can put on your plate. And let me tell you, our farmers, they grow the best potatoes. The best. They’re huge, they’re beautiful, they’re red, white, and yellow.”\n\nWhat exactly makes this language sound like Trump — the content? The syntax? The colloquial diction — “folks” and “let me tell you”? The rhythm and repetition of “They’re huge, they’re beautiful, they’re red”? All the above? What’s striking about this example is that ChatGPT is not so much imitating Trump’s voice as exaggerating its features into a caricature, almost as if the chatbot has picked up on the man’s very essence.\n\nGood character impressions delight us because they illuminate something fundamental about the person they imitate. Alec Baldwin claimed that the secret to his masterful Trump impression was to unlock an element of his character: “You can kind of suggest the voice, or suggest the way they look, but you’ve got to try to think of who he is,” Baldwin said in an interview. “And to me, Trump is someone who is always searching for a stronger, better word, and he never finds it.” Somehow, ChatGPT gets to that core in its potato speech, repeating the word “best” three times in three sentences.\n\nWilliam Zinsser, in his classic book, “On Writing Well,” explains that “we express ourselves as we do” because of the “subconscious mind.” Perhaps ChatGPT’s deft impressions show us that our language patterns reveal more about our character than we might realize. And its facility at imitating style has implications for copyright — to what extent should we view the rhetorical tendencies that make up one’s writing voice as proprietary?\n\nSome writers seem unsettled when faced with AI renditions of their own style. Douglas Hofstadter, author of “Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid,” noted that GPT-4, when prompted to write in his voice, produced what he termed a “Hofstader façade,” or a series of “vague generalities that echo phrases in the book” rather than a seemingly authentic replica of his writing style. And songwriter Nick Cave called ChatGPT’s attempt to write lyrics in his style “a grotesque mockery of what it is to be human.”\n\nBut the technology’s capacity for imitation will likely continue to improve: New Yorker staff writer Kyle Chayka observed that ChatGPT was not very effective at mimicking his own writing voice, but the AI startup, Writer, created a bot trained on his own writing to produce text in his voice that, while not perfect, was still “unnervingly effective.” Chayka expressed mixed feelings about this capability: “The robot has made me acutely self-conscious. I recognize my A.I. doppelganger, and I don’t like it.”\n\n“Perhaps ChatGPT’s deft impressions show us that our language patterns reveal more about our character than we might realize. And its facility at imitating style has implications for copyright — to what extent should we view the rhetorical tendencies that make up one’s writing voice as proprietary?”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nWhen a human mimics the style of another writer, the imitation can be seen as flattery, elevating the original writer’s work through its homage; when an AI does it, the act feels more like a flattening, a reduction of our voices to its discovered patterns of idiosyncrasies and tics, our variability and range limited in favor of recognizability.\n\nIntimacy Through Writing\nWhat is the voice of ChatGPT? When it lacks instructions to imitate a particular voice, it presumably imitates all of us, averaging our voices together into an indistinct default. Conversing with the chatbot feels like encountering someone you recognize but have never met — a voice of the masses, distant yet familiar. \n\n(But of course, it’s not really the voice of the masses — the algorithm inherently prioritizes the writing patterns of those that have published most often, letting them dominate over underrepresented groups and writing styles.)\n\nWhen speaking as itself, the chatbot sounds neutral, unanimated, optimistic, but not especially enthusiastic to be talking with you. It often opts for lists sandwiched between a clear introduction and conclusion. \n\nRead Noema in print.\nWhen asked to comment on controversial or debatable issues, it resists taking a strong stance, instead describing tradeoffs or multiple points of view; although, it’s also been reported to have liberal-slanting political views. Its tendency to explain things in a flat, monotone style can make it sound a little condescending, yet it also apologizes when corrected — it seems to want to be helpful.\n\nBut something critical is missing from its voice: a certain sense of connection. At its core, writing is about creating intimacy between writer and reader. It’s a relational act, not a one-sided performance, and its power is in the exchange of ideas. It’s the closest we can get to inhabiting the mind of another human, the closest to escaping our own egos. \n\n“So what?” is the common refrain of writing teachers. “Why should your reader care?” A key way that good writing achieves connection is by creating stakes, or engaging the reader by showing them why your ideas matter. \n\nFiction creates stakes through establishing consequences — what does the protagonist stand to lose in their journey? Argumentative writing creates stakes by establishing significance — what are the implications for the individual or society? The stakes don’t need to be high, but for the writing to be engaging, they should be urgent and viscerally apparent.\n\nStakes are the parts that reach up off the page and out into the world to connect with the reader, to shift their interior state, to make us want to keep reading. Without emotional stakes, even virtuosic texts can feel difficult, off-putting or cold; the emotional payoff is low relative to the energy they take to read. \n\nWe appreciate literary prowess, but engaging the reader matters more — we seem to want more than just spectacle from good writing. As readers, we need to feel like the writer is paying attention to us, trying to connect. ChatGPT cannot build a real connection with its reader — it can only imitate one.\n\nReading ChatGPT’s writing feels uncanny because there’s no driver at the wheel, no real connection being built. While the machine can articulate stakes, it is indifferent to them; it doesn’t care if we care, and somehow that diminishes its power. Its writing tends not to move us emotionally; at best, it evokes a sense of muted awe akin to watching a trained dog shake a hand: Hey, look what it can do.\n\nNarrative writing tends to become more relatable and engaging as it gains specificity — but ChatGPT is a collective voice, not a specific one, and so even as the algorithm improves, we will likely continue to find its writing emotionally inadequate. Perhaps the ineffable spark of good writing and the spark of a romantic connection are related — both involve a certain energy exchange, a sense of connection across individual minds, a balance of surprise and familiarity.\n\nChatGPT gets closest to achieving a sense of spark when asked to juxtapose incongruous topics and styles. When commanded to compose a sonnet about McDonald’s, for instance, it writes:\n\nIn golden realms where cravings find their bliss,\n\nWhere hunger’s fire meets flavor’s sweetest kiss,\n\nThere stands a haven with arches of gold,\n\nMcDonald’s, where delights and dreams unfold. \n\nThe writing isn’t Pulitzer-worthy, but it has a certain energy that perhaps stems from the surprise of seeing how the program tackled the prompt’s challenge — you can’t help but feel like ChatGPT is in on the joke. It’s almost as if a personality starts to form — a little cheeky, willing to embarrass itself to make us laugh.\n\n“As readers, we need to feel like the writer is paying attention to us, trying to connect. ChatGPT cannot build a real connection with its reader — it can only imitate one.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\n“You silly humans,” the chatbot seems to be saying. “Using the greatest technology of our generation to create funny memes. But okay, I’ll play along.” These moments convey a sense of energy that makes it hard for me to believe I’m not chatting with a sentient being. Perhaps having a strong voice simply means writing in a way that makes you seem alive.\n\nIf this poem were written by a human, its voice probably wouldn’t have the same strength — it might feel cheesy and oddly reverential of the fast-food chain. Once we know ChatGPT generated the poem, however, its quality improves — we get the feeling the technology is unwittingly commenting on our world, illuminating the categories we use to understand it. \n\nThe McDonald’s sonnet isn’t interesting as a poem — it’s interesting as the output of an algorithm programmed with knowledge of our writing and our world. Perhaps AI-generated writing has the potential to be interesting or meaningful in contexts where the chatbot’s lack of awareness and intentionality matters; when the fact that the machine is not sentient amplifies the impact of its output; when the writing is, in some sense, about AI-generated writing. \n\nBut AI-generated writing about AI-generated writing is a narrow niche and there are limits to how long we’ll find it compelling.\n\nEthics Of Plagiarism\nWe tend to believe that good writing is original and thus advise writers to avoid clichés — phrases used so often we’ve come to see them as unoriginal and thoughtless. Clichés spring to mind too easily, careening along well-paved neural pathways, whereas original phrases must be pulled from the quicksand of our brains with significant effort. \n\nWe scorn clichés not because they’re bad descriptions — indeed, the reason they linger is probably because they’re pretty decent — but because their familiarity is off-putting, a sign of writerly laziness. Even when ChatGPT doesn’t use clichés, its writing still echoes of them; there’s usually the sense that there might be a fresher, more original way to say things.\n\nGood writing, we believe, not only avoids phrases taken from the general consciousness, but also avoids language taken from individual writers unless acknowledged by quotation marks, and it credits others for their ideas with citations. \n\nWe expect students to read widely and build arguments that use others’ texts as support for their own. But to maintain so-called “academic integrity,” they must do this using fresh language and draw explicit distinctions between their own ideas and others’ — with the exception of information that is considered general knowledge. But what is general knowledge in a world where virtually any information is freely accessible online? \n\nChatGPT, in a sense, plagiarizes our voices as it parrots the writing it was trained on. It tends not to cite the specific sources it synthesizes to craft its phrases, and when it does, they are unreliable — the MLA Style Center website cautions writers to “vet” any secondary sources that appear in AI-generated text, as the programs have the occasional tendency to “hallucinate” false sources and provide information of questionable accuracy. Given the opacity of the AI’s sources, a student who tries to pass off AI-generated text as their own may be inadvertently performing a multi-dimensional transgression, plagiarizing an AI that itself is plagiarizing others.  \n\nThe ethics of training AI on copyrighted materials are murky, too. Platforms like Reddit are pushing back against AI developers’ use of their content, and Sarah Silverman and other authors recently sued OpenAI for electronically ingesting illegally uploaded versions of their books from the internet to use as training data for ChatGPT. The Writers Guild of America, on strike since May, seeks to regulate the use of AI, both by preventing human-authored scripts from becoming AI training data and limiting AI tools in the writer’s room. \n\nBut if generative AI becomes as widely adopted as the Google search engine, will authors still want to opt out of contributing to it, or will serving as a model for the algorithm become a way to amplify their own literary influence, an honor akin to being ranked at the top of a Google search result? Should we work to protect the right to be excluded from AI training data, or the right to be included in it? \n\nSo far, universities mostly seem to categorize the unacknowledged use of AI as traditional plagiarism and continue to treat it as unacceptable, with students receiving Fs or even suspensions if caught. While software has been developed to detect AI-generated text, ChatGPT’s chameleonic potency makes the accuracy of these programs questionable.\n\n“Writing is more than simply a sequence of words — it’s synonymous with thought. To steal others’ language is to take not just their words but also their ideas, the essence of who they are.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nTheir relevance is debatable, too — what’s the value we’re trying to preserve by differentiating human writing from AI? Is it really plagiarism not to cite an AI-generated phrase? Is plagiarism still the crime we think it is?\n\nPerhaps the ethics of using generative AI depend, again, on intention. An anonymous professor recently queried The New York Times Magazine’s “The Ethicist” advice column about whether it was ethical to use ChatGPT to generate administrative reports and proposals. Kwame Anthony Appiah’s response differentiated between writing that aspires to be original versus that which does not. He authorized the letter writer to use the tool with the rationale that “many administrative documents, though they may have signatories, aren’t thought of as original compositions,” pointing out that these texts often use templates as a starting point anyway. \n\nBut this distinction troubles me: How can we tell what kinds of writing are meant to be original and which are not? What exactly does originality mean? More practically, why do so many workplaces ask us to produce such unoriginal texts – what kind of value do they produce? \n\nWriting As Thought\nHistorically, we have viewed plagiarism as an egregious offense. At most universities, students caught plagiarizing receive Fs or even suspensions, and outside academia, the act can result in book recalls and career-ruining embarrassment. \n\nWhy do we consider it so disgraceful? Because we believe writing is more than simply a sequence of words — it’s synonymous with thought. To steal others’ language is to take not just their words but also their ideas, the essence of who they are.\n\nOur tendency to conflate writing with thought is why text-generating AI programs like ChatGPT give off the impression of sentience while image-generating programs do not, and why large language models are the primary targets of recent petitions to slow and regulate AI advancement. If ChatGPT can write coherently, our intuition tells us, surely it can think — and if it can think, how can we possibly maintain control over it? \n\nI like to say that I’m not teaching my students how to write — I’m teaching them how to think; how to be observant; how to question the systems around them; how to interpret and build meaning; how to relate to others; how to understand and differentiate themselves; how to become agents of change. But ChatGPT, by producing competent writing with apparent thoughtlessness, threatens the idea that critical thinking is the core of good writing.\n\nWith its startling ability to regenerate responses by paraphrasing the same ideas in new words ad infinitum, it mocks the weight we put on paraphrasing to avoid plagiarism. We task students with summarizing texts in their own words to demonstrate their understanding of the material — but ChatGPT shows us that it’s possible to explain others’ ideas without understanding them; to build arguments from their content without metacognition.\n\nIts revelation is reversing how we tend to think writing works: First, you come up with an idea. Second, you find the words to articulate it. But ChatGPT inverts this process. It begins with the words and builds its arguments and narratives based on language patterns, letting its ideas emerge from the text it uses to produce them.\n\nWhen I write, I imagine reaching up to a higher plane to access my thoughts and assign words to them, yet the words I find are approximate and never capture the ideas as fully as they appear in my mind. This is why writing feels so hard to me: Its labor involves grasping for a perfect translation and always falling short. But ChatGPT reminds us that language is a lens, and our thoughts and perceptions are almost certainly shaped in some way by its conventions and metaphors. It shows us that writing influences our thoughts even as we use it to describe them. \n\nWe tend to view writing as hyper-personal, a conduit for our unique thoughts. But ChatGPT, through its own training, reminds us that we learn to write through imitation, the same way we learn to smile or eat or walk. Children grow up speaking with the accent of their peers, not their parents; in the same way, writing is a networked, communal act, inseparable from others’ writing.\n\nWe write in conversation with what we read, and good writing balances our own words with others’. We summarize their ideas, using them as springboards and support for our arguments. We take language from others, too, and not just as quotations: The English language is a colonial artifact that swallows up other languages. It’s full of stolen words and idioms and familiar, tired phrases — things we say because others say them.\n\n“Perhaps the ineffable spark of good writing and the spark of a romantic connection are related — both involve a certain energy exchange, a sense of connection across individual minds, a balance of surprise and familiarity.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nAs AI technology progresses, we will need to reconsider our conceptions of authorship and intellectual property. If you command unique text into existence by inputting a prompt into ChatGPT, have you authored that text? If ChatGPT edits or rewrites your work, is it still yours? If not, what kind of attribution would be valuable? Does the premise of intellectual property still hold water in a world with generative AI? Where’s the line between a “fair use” iteration of someone else’s text — a creative remake of a Shakespeare play, for instance — and more problematic appropriation? \n\nLarge language models challenge our understanding of originality and ask us to reexamine what value it adds to good writing. Is an original thought in the kernel of the idea or its phrasing? What makes a phrase original — the novelty of a word sequence, the context of its use or the readers’ perception of it? Are there any new ideas, or just new ways of saying them? Can AI generate original ideas by remixing old phrases? How original should good writing be, regardless of whether the author is human, AI or a combination?\n\nCosts Of Optimization\nIt’s an incongruous time to be alive. We’re watching technology evolve in a more sophisticated way than we can understand or even track, and yet, our environmental, political and economic systems feel on the verge of collapse. We now live in a world where a free online program can generate convincing human-like prose more quickly than any human can read or even think. \n\nMeanwhile, about one in 10 people worldwide — 773 million adults, mostly women — are illiterate. Almost a third of the world’s population, or 2.9 billion people, have not been on the internet in the past three months, if ever. Let’s not forget that optimization tools mostly impact the productivity of those with access to them.\n\nEven if writing quality isn’t optimized, these tools save us time and effort — and the savings are significant. While immersed in the process of writing, you might experience a “flow” state in which the task of assigning words to thoughts becomes so absorbing that your sense of time passing falls away — but meaningful time gets lost when we spend time reflecting and writing instead of accumulating lived experiences. Life is short and writing time has a real cost: The hours I took to compose this piece could have been spent with family or friends, volunteering or working on any number of other projects or hobbies.\n\nI’ve heard writer-parents say having a baby is equivalent to losing two books’ worth of time. And time is worth money: Full-time writing is a privilege that few can afford, with most writers stealing scraps of time between day jobs. \n\nOptimizing the effort involved with writing is no small thing, either. The process requires an unparalleled level of focus, and for many it ushers in feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt. We take writing failures personally because we see writing as thought, so failing to express ourselves well in writing can sting more than other forms of expression. As a result, many end up terrified of the blank page, and AI becomes a tempting corrective.\n\nAutomation promises to accelerate time-consuming tasks and make us more productive. But when it comes to writing, do we need more productivity? If chatbots become widely adopted, who’s going to read all that text? \n\nAnyone who’s published knows that readership is a rare gift. Reading is work — valuable work — but like writing, it requires exertion and takes time away from other tasks. Many of us already feel saturated with content; we consume so much information through screens that our daily attention spans feel fragile and limited. There’s a certain respect we hold for writers who are careful not to publish too much, who honor their readers enough to self-censor and share only what’s really worth our attention. \n\nAnd what will become of our own writing after reading so much AI-authored prose? Will we begin to write more like ChatGPT in a linguistic mise en abyme? Will we lose the sense that reading and writing offer a solution to loneliness, the chance to connect deeply with another human’s inner world, given the growing uncertainty about whether a human is even present behind a given text?\n\nPerhaps something meaningful is lost when we use AI to reduce the time and effort spent writing. Writing well takes practice, and I see the most significant progression in students who spend the most time writing, reworking draft after draft. To “essay” is to try — perhaps good writing is about trying, about process as much as outcome. \n\nIf AI becomes commonplace, perhaps we will wind up most admiring those writers who proclaim to do the hard work of generating their own prose from scratch, slowly and painfully. Like organic produce or designer handbags, perhaps human-authored text will someday carry labels certifying its authenticity. Or maybe our preference for the real over the artificial will simply fade as differentiating between the two becomes increasingly difficult.\n\nBut even if a reader can’t be sure whether a text had AI support, the writer knows, and producing unassisted writing can feel deeply gratifying. We run marathons and climb mountains for the sake of it; because they’re hard. Maybe the parts of writing that feel so burdensome — the effort to think deeply, to sit still with our thoughts, to articulate them and revise them until they say exactly what we want, until we figure out what we’re trying to say at all — are the parts that we value when we praise good writing. \n\nPerhaps the time spent writing matters as much as having written; there is a vague sense of being, in the moment of writing, the most authentic version of yourself.\n\nWriting To Differentiate Ourselves\nWhat makes good writing in a world with generative AI? Perhaps writing classes of the future will lean into the subtle ways in which human writing surpasses AI-generated writing and challenge students to write better than the machine. \n\nPerhaps they will teach students to be AI curators and remixers, teaching the prompt engineering skills they need to leverage the technology most effectively, in preparation for the kind of sparkless, functional writing they will produce post-graduation — contracts, reports, meeting minutes, instructional manuals. \n\nPerhaps the college essay will be retired in favor of other assignments that demonstrate knowledge, critical thinking and argumentation skills — speeches, hands-on activities or multimedia creations. It seems likely we will continue to teach students to read widely and study textual patterns and conventions closely — the same way we train AI to write.\n\nBut perhaps ChatGPT also shows us that at a certain point, reading has diminishing returns. Maybe we also need to be trained on other kinds of data in order to write well, data that comes from being alive in the world over time, from accumulating enough experience to differentiate our own voice from others. \n\nWriting courses are different from other disciplines — they’re not so much about transferring knowledge or conveying conceptual frameworks. Instead, they aim to create a space in which students can practice differentiating themselves.\n\nTeaching writing usually involves one-on-one meetings, a structure that allows me to build relationships with students. Through reading their writing and talking about their ideas, I watch them begin to fill in the templates of their personalities and experiment with specificity, trying out various attitudes, disciplines, hobbies, relationships, styles and habits, and in the process, becoming themselves. They hone their craft not only by learning about writing conventions but also by learning about who they are and what they think, by figuring out how their perspectives align and differ from others’.\n\nGenerative AI complicates this mission, but it doesn’t terminate it. The division between the words and ideas that belong to us versus others has always been more ambiguous than we’d like to think, and ChatGPT blurs that line further. Even if we use AI to make writing feel easier, we still need to do the hard, lifelong work of becoming ourselves.\n\nTo write well, you need the specificity of perspective that comes from communicating critically with others over an extended time. AI might make writing faster, but figuring out who we are in relation to others cannot be accelerated. \n\nWe may see writing as equal to thought, but it is also synonymous with power. Allowing AI to write for us gives away our power and the opportunity to assert control over the way we represent ourselves to the world.\n\nAs we continue to debate whether using AI violates university policies on academic integrity, I am reminded that the word “integrity” means not just honesty and moral uprightness, but also wholeness, an integration of parts. Education is about recognizing the limits of our own subjective impressions, inhabiting others’ perspectives, and aligning them with our own. Perhaps writing with integrity means integrating our selves with others through the act of writing to form a coherent whole.\n\nThe tension between the individual and the collective, between novelty and familiarity, drives the arc of our lives. We are conceived from the text of others’ DNA and emerge with our own combinations. We grow up learning to imitate those who raise us, then rebel from them as we battle to find ourselves amid the influences of society. We use writing to differentiate ourselves, to respond to others, weaving their words with our own, synthesizing their ideas, adding new ones and exploring where we align and diverge.\n\nBeyond mirroring elements of our voices, maybe AI also mirrors the tensions we feel between ourselves and others. Perhaps large language models, if we interact with them critically, will open new frames through which to explore the balance between the ways we conform and the ways we break free, adding depth to the mission of self-discovery that defines our lives.",

      "blog_post": "If you have some experience in building enterprise applications, chances are you have used a Linux system. The Linux command-line interface (CLI) is an essential feature that developers appreciate. The CLI is powerful and flexible, allowing developers to perform complex tasks quickly and efficiently. In this post, I would like to list down 10 most useful commands which every developer should know.\n\nI am intentionally omitting some of the basic but very widely used commands e.g. ls, cd,mkdir, rm, cp, mv and so on with an assumption that they are too basic and should be already known to most of the regular users.\n\n1 . tail (display the last lines of a file)\ntail is a Linux command that displays the last part of a file or multiple files. It can be useful for monitoring log files or keeping track of changes to a file in real time.\n\nHere are some commonly used options for tail and some examples of how to use them:\n\n-n or --lines: This option specifies the number of lines to display.\n\nDisplay the last 5 lines of a file:\n\n\nCOPY\n   tail -n 5 file1.txt\n   ## will display first 5 lines for file1.txt\n-f or --follow: This option will output the last part of a file in real-time as it is being written to. This is commonly used for monitoring log files.\n\nDisplay new log entries as they are added to the file.\n\n\nCOPY\n\n tail -f /var/log/messages\n ## will start straming file from end.\n-q or --quiet: This option suppresses the display of file headers when displaying multiple files.\n\nDisplay only the last 5 lines of each file without showing the filename headers.\n\n\nCOPY\n tail -q -n 5 file1.txt file2.txt\n ## will show content from file1,file2 stacked with out name(file1.txt,file2.txt)\n-c or --bytes: This option specifies the number of bytes to display.\n\nDisplay the last 100 bytes of file1.txt\n\n\nCOPY\n   tail -c 100 file1.txt\n   ## shows 100 bytes starting from end\n-v or --verbose: This option displays the name of each file before the output.\n\nDisplay \"==> file1.txt <==\" before the last 5 lines of the file.\n\n\nCOPY\n   tail -v file1.txt\n   ## ==> file1.txt <== followed by the content of file\nThese are just a few examples of how tail can be used. By combining these options and using tail with other commands, you can create powerful and flexible file monitoring and processing tools.\n\n2 . head (display the first lines of a file)\nhead is a command in Linux used to display the first few lines of a file. By default, it displays the first 10 lines of a file. Here are some examples of using head with different options:\n\nDisplay the first 5 lines of a file:\n\nCOPY\nhead -n 5 file.txt\nDisplay the first 20 bytes of a file:\n\nCOPY\nhead -c 20 file.txt\nDisplay the first line of multiple files:\n\nCOPY\nhead -n 1 file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt\nDisplay the first few lines of a file, with a message indicating the file name:\n\nCOPY\nhead -v file.txt\nDisplay the first 5 lines of a file, and include the line numbers:\n\nCOPY\nhead -n 5 -v file.txt\nHere, the options used are:\n\n-n: specify the number of lines to display.\n\n-c: specify the number of bytes to display.\n\n-v: display the name of the file before the output.\n\nThese are just a few examples of using head with different options. There are many other options available that can be used to customize the output of this command which you can explore with tail --help.\n\n3 . cat (concatenate and display files)\nThe cat command is used to concatenate and display files. It can also be used to create new files by combining existing files. Here are some examples of using the cat command with various options:\n\nDisplay contents of a single file:\n\nCOPY\ncat file.txt\nCombine multiple files and display their contents:\n\nCOPY\ncat file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt\nDisplay line numbers along with file contents:\n\nCOPY\ncat -b file.txt\n     1  In web applications, it's common to have long-running processes that need to be executed asynchronously.\n     2  When these processes take a long time to complete,\n     3  it's important to provide feedback to the user so\n     4  that they know what's happening and can cont\nAppend one file to another:\n\nCOPY\ncat file1.txt >> file2.txt\nCreate a new file by combining existing files:\n\nCOPY\ncat file1.txt file2.txt > newfile.txt\nIn the first example, cat is used to display the contents of a single file.\n\nIn the second example, cat is used to combine multiple files and display their contents.\n\nIn the third example, the -n option is used to display line numbers along with file contents.\n\nIn the fourth example, the >> operator is used to append the contents of one file to another.\n\nIn the fifth example, the > operator is used to create a new file by combining the contents of two existing files.\n\n4 . diff ( compare two files line by line)\nThe diff command in Linux is used to compare two files line by line and show the differences between them. It can also be used to compare two directories and their contents.\n\nHere are some common options used with the diff command:\n\n-u or --unified: shows the differences in a unified format, making it easier to read and understand.\n\n-c or --context: shows the differences in a context format, which includes a few lines before and after each difference to provide more context.\n\n-r or --recursive: compares directories and their contents recursively.\n\n-i or --ignore-case: ignores case differences in the files being compared.\n\n-w or --ignore-all-space: ignores all whitespace differences in the files being compared.\n\nHere are some examples of using the diff command with different options:\n\nExample 1: Compare two files using the default output format\n\n\nCOPY\ndiff file1.txt file2.txt\nExample 2: Compare two files using the unified output format\n\n\nCOPY\ndiff -u file1.txt file2.txt\nExample 3: Compare two directories and their contents recursively\n\n\nCOPY\ndiff -r dir1/ dir2/\nExample 4: Compare two files ignoring case differences\n\n\nCOPY\ndiff -i file1.txt file2.txt\nExample 5: Compare two files ignoring all whitespace differences\n\n\nCOPY\ndiff -w file1.txt file2.txt\nIn these examples, file1.txt and file2.txt are files being compared, and dir1/ and dir2/ are directories being compared. The output of the diff command shows the differences between the files or directories. By using different options, the output format and the behavior of the diff command can be customized.\n\n5 . patch (apply a diff file to a file or directory)\npatch is a command-line tool that allows you to apply a patch file to a file or directory. A patch file is a file that contains the differences between two versions of a file or directory. When you apply a patch file, the changes in the patch file are applied to the file or directory, resulting in a new version of the file or directory.\n\nHere are some examples of how to use the patch command with different options:\n\nExample 1: Apply a patch to a file\n\nSuppose you have a patch file called patch.diff and a file called file.txt. To apply the patch to the file, you can use the following command:\n\n\nCOPY\npatch file.txt patch.diff\nThis command will apply the changes in the patch file to the file.\n\nExample 2: Apply a patch to a directory\n\nSuppose you have a patch file called patch.diff and a directory called dir/. To apply the patch to the directory and all its files, you can use the following command:\n\n\nCOPY\npatch -p1 < patch.diff\nThe -p1 option tells patch to strip one level of the directory path from the files in the patch file. This is necessary because the patch file contains the full path to the files.\n\nExample 3: Create a patch file\n\nSuppose you have two files called file1.txt and file2.txt and you want to create a patch file that contains the differences between the two files. To create the patch file, you can use the following command:\n\n\nCOPY\ndiff -u file1.txt file2.txt > patch.diff\nThis command will create a patch file called patch.diff that contains the differences between file1.txt and file2.txt.\n\nExample 4: Ignore whitespace changes\n\nSuppose your patch file contains changes that only affect whitespace. To ignore these changes when applying the patch, you can use the following command:\n\n\nCOPY\npatch -l file.txt patch.diff\nThe -l option tells patch to ignore changes in whitespace.\n\nExample 5: Apply a patch with dry-run\n\nSuppose you want to see what changes a patch file will make before applying it. To do this, you can use the following command:\n\n\nCOPY\npatch --dry-run file.txt patch.diff\nThe --dry-run option tells patch to simulate the patching process without actually making any changes to the file. This can be useful for testing a patch file before applying it.\n\nThese are just a few examples of how to use the patch command. patch provides many options for customizing the patching process, so be sure to consult the manual (man patch) for more information.\n\n6 . tar (extract files from the archive/create an archive from files )\ntar is a command-line utility in Linux that is used to create and extract archives from one or more files or directories. The name \"tar\" stands for \"tape archive,\" as it was originally designed to write data to tape drives.\n\nHere are some of the commonly used options with tar:\n\n-c (create) - create a new archive\n\n-x (extract) - extract files from an archive\n\n-v (verbose) - display progress and filenames while processing\n\n-f (file) - specify the filename of the archive\n\n-z (gzip) - compress or uncompress the archive using gzip\n\nHere are five examples of using tar with different options:\n\nCreate a new archive of all files in the current directory:\n\nCOPY\ntar -cvf archive.tar *\nExtract all files from an archive:\n\nCOPY\ntar -xvf archive.tar\nExtract all files from a gzip-compressed archive:\n\nCOPY\ntar -xzvf archive.tar.gz\nCreate a gzip-compressed archive of a directory:\n\nCOPY\ntar -czvf archive.tar.gz directory/\nExtract a specific file from an archive:\n\nCOPY\ntar -xvf archive.tar file.txt\nThese are just a few examples of how tar can be used to create and extract archives. The utility offers many more options and can be used in more complex ways for a variety of use cases.\n\n7 . sed (stream editor for filtering and transforming text)\nsed (stream editor) is a extremly powerful tool used for filtering and transforming text. It can be used to modify text files in place, or to process text output from other commands. sed works by reading input line by line, applying a set of rules (expressions) to each line, and then printing the modified result to the output.\n\nHere are 10 examples of sed commands with explanations of their options:\n\nReplace all occurrences of a string in a file with another string:\n\n\nCOPY\n sed -i 's/old_string/new_string/g' file.txt\nThe -i option is used to modify the file in place. The s command replaces the first occurrence of old_string with new_string. The g flag at the end specifies that all occurrences should be replaced.\n\nRemove all occurrences of a string in a file:\n\n\nCOPY\n sed -i '/string_to_remove/d' file.txt\nThe /string_to_remove/d expression deletes all lines that contain string_to_remove. The -i option is used to modify the file in place.\n\nAdd a line to the beginning of a file:\n\n\nCOPY\n sed -i '1i\\new_line' file.txt\nThe 1i\\ command inserts new_line at line 1 of the file. The -i option is used to modify the file in place.\n\nAdd a line to the end of a file:\n\n\nCOPY\n sed -i '$a\\new_line' file.txt\nThe $a\\ command appends new_line to the end of the file. The -i option is used to modify the file in place.\n\nRemove empty lines from a file:\n\n\nCOPY\n pythonCopy codesed -i '/^$/d' file.txt\nThe /^$/d expression deletes all lines that are empty (contain only whitespace). The -i option is used to modify the file in place.\n\nReplace the first occurrence of a string in a file on a specific line number:\n\n\nCOPY\n sed -i '3s/old_string/new_string/' file.txt\nThe 3s/old_string/new_string/ expression replaces the first occurrence of old_string with new_string on line number 3. The -i option is used to modify the file in place.\n\nRemove all whitespace from the beginning and end of each line:\n\n\nCOPY\n sed -i 's/^[[:space:]]*//;s/[[:space:]]*$//' file.txt\nThe s/^[[:space:]]*// expression removes all whitespace from the beginning of each line. The s/[[:space:]]*$// expression removes all whitespace from the end of each line. The -i option is used to modify the file in place.\n\nRemove a specific line from a file:\n\n\nCOPY\n sed -i '5d' file.txt\nThe 5d expression deletes line number 5 from the file. The -i option is used to modify the file in place.\n\nReplace a string in a file only on lines that match a specific pattern:\n\n\nCOPY\n sed -i '/pattern/s/old_string/new_string/' file.txt\nThe /pattern/ expression matches all lines that contain pattern. The s/old_string/new_string/ expression replaces the first occurrence of old_string with new_string on all matching lines. The -i option is used to modify the file.\n\nRemove all consecutive duplicate lines from a file:\n\n\nCOPY\nsed -i '$!N; /^\\(.*\\)\\n\\1$/!P; D' file.txt\nIn conclusion, sed is a versatile command-line tool that can be used to perform a wide range of text-processing tasks. Its ability to read and modify files line by line makes it particularly useful for working with large text files, and its powerful regular expression capabilities provide a flexible and efficient way to search for and manipulate text. With practice, developers can become proficient at using sed to streamline their text processing workflows and automate common tasks.\n\n8 . awk (pattern scanning and processing language)\nAWK is a programming language designed for text processing and data extraction. It is especially useful for processing files that contain structured data, such as CSV files, log files, and configuration files. AWK provides a range of built-in functions for manipulating strings, performing arithmetic operations, and manipulating data structures such as arrays.\n\nHere are 10 examples of how to use AWK, along with explanations of the options used:\n\nPrint the first field of each line in a file:\n\nCOPY\nawk '{print $1}' filename.txt\nThis command tells AWK to print the first field of each line in the file filename.txt. The $1 variable refers to the first field of the current line.\n\nPrint the second field of each line in a file:\n\nCOPY\nawk '{print $2}' filename.txt\nThis command tells AWK to print the second field of each line in the file filename.txt. The $2 variable refers to the second field of the current line.\n\nPrint the last field of each line in a file:\n\nCOPY\nawk '{print $NF}' filename.txt\nThis command tells AWK to print the last field of each line in the file filename.txt. The $NF variable refers to the last field of the current line.\n\nPrint all fields of each line in a file:\n\nCOPY\nawk '{print $0}' filename.txt\nThis command tells AWK to print the entire line for each line in the file filename.txt. The $0 variable refers to the entire line.\n\nPrint the total number of lines in a file:\n\nCOPY\nawk 'END {print NR}' filename.txt\nThis command tells AWK to print the number of records (NR) at the end of the file. The END keyword specifies that this action should be taken after all lines have been processed.\n\nPrint the total number of fields in a file:\n\nCOPY\nawk '{print NF}' filename.txt | sort -rn | head -1\nThis command tells AWK to print the number of fields for each line in the file filename.txt. The output is then piped to sort -rn to sort the results in reverse numerical order, and head -1 is used to print the first line (i.e., the line with the highest number of fields).\n\nIn conclusion, AWK is a powerful tool for processing text files and extracting data. By learning AWK, developers can streamline their workflows and automate common text-processing tasks.\n\n9 . grep (search for a pattern in a file)\ngrep is a command-line tool used for searching text in files or directories. It can search for a specific pattern in a file and return the lines that contain that pattern. Here is the basic syntax of the grep command:\n\n\nCOPY\ngrep [OPTIONS] PATTERN [FILE...]\nIn this syntax, OPTIONS are the different options available for the grep command, PATTERN is the text pattern to search for, and FILE is the file or files to search in.\n\nHere are 7 examples of using grep command with some of the commonly used options:\n\nSearch for a pattern in a file:\n\n\nCOPY\n grep \"pattern\" file.txt\nSearch for a pattern in multiple files:\n\n\nCOPY\n grep \"pattern\" file1.txt file2.txt\nSearch for a pattern in all files in a directory:\n\n\nCOPY\n grep \"pattern\" *\nSearch for a pattern in a file, ignoring case:\n\n\nCOPY\n grep -i \"pattern\" file.txt\nSearch for a pattern in a file, with line numbers:\n\n\nCOPY\n grep -n \"pattern\" file.txt\nSearch for a pattern in a file, showing only the matching text:\n\n\nCOPY\n grep -o \"pattern\" file.txt\nSearch for a pattern in all files in a directory recursively:\n\n\nCOPY\n grep -r \"pattern\" directory/\nFind all the files which do not have a specific pattern:\n\n\nCOPY\n grep -v \"pattern\" file.txt\nThe -v option in grep is used to invert the search and display only the lines that do not contain the specified pattern\n\nThese are just a few examples of the many options available with grep. The grep command can be a powerful tool for searching text in files and directories, and can be used in combination with other commands to perform complex operations on text files.\n\n10. cut (remove sections from each line of a file)\ncut is a command-line utility in Linux that is used to extract parts of a file or a stream of data by specifying a delimiter. Here is a brief overview of the options available for cut:\n\n\nCOPY\n-d <delimiter>  - Specify a delimiter character\n-f <field_list> - Specify a list of fields to extract\nHere are 7 examples of using cut with different options:\n\nExtract the first field of each line of a file:\n\nCOPY\ncut -d',' -f1 file.txt\nThis command uses , as the delimiter and extracts the first field of each line of file.txt.\n\nExtract the first 3 characters of each line of a file:\n\nCOPY\ncut -c1-3 file.txt\nThis command extracts the first three characters of each line of file.txt.\n\nExtract the last field of each line of a file:\n\nCOPY\ncut -d',' -fNF file.txt\nThis command uses , as the delimiter and extracts the last field of each line of file.txt.\n\nExtract the 2nd and 3rd fields of each line of a file:\n\nCOPY\ncut -d',' -f2,3 file.txt\nThis command uses , as the delimiter and extracts the 2nd and 3rd fields of each line of file.txt.\n\nExtract the characters between the 10th and 20th positions of each line of a file:\n\nCOPY\ncut -c10-20 file.txt\nThis command extracts the characters between the 10th and 20th positions of each line of file.txt.\n\nExtract the first and last fields of each line of a file:\n\nCOPY\ncut -d',' -f1,NF file.txt\nThis command uses , as the delimiter and extracts the first and last fields of each line of file.txt.\n\nExtract the fields in reverse order of each line of a file:\n\nCOPY\ncut -d',' --output-delimiter=' ' -f$(awk -F, '{print NF; exit}')-1 file.txt\nThis command uses , as the delimiter and extracts the fields of each line of file.txt in reverse order, separated by a space. The awk command is used to get the number of fields in the file and pass it to cut to extract the fields in reverse order.\n\nExtract fields 2 through 4 of a file using a tab delimiter:\n\nCOPY\nbashCopy codecut -d$'\\t' -f2-4 file.txt\nThis command uses a tab character as the delimiter and extracts fields 2 through 4 of each line of file.txt.\n\nIn conclusion, cut is a versatile and useful command-line utility for extracting fields or characters from a file or a stream of data. It is often used in conjunction with other commands such as awk and sed to manipulate and process text files. By mastering cut, developers can become more efficient at working with data and automating tasks on a Linux system.\n\nHonorable mention\nWhile the commands covered in this post are certainly useful for developers, it's important to note that there are many more Linux commands worth exploring and becoming familiar with. Due to the limitations of length, I did not cover them here.\n\nFor example, curl and wget are powerful tools for downloading files from the web, top and ps provide information on system processes, kill is useful for terminating processes, and ping and traceroute are essential for checking network connectivity. ssh and scp are valuable for remote login and file transfer, respectively.\n\nBy using the --help option or referring to Linux command manuals, developers can continue to learn about new commands and improve their workflow. I welcome any feedback or comments from our readers and hope that this post has helped expand your knowledge of commonly used Linux commands.\n\nHappy Learning.\n\n",

      "blog_post": "Each year in the United States, up to one billion birds die after colliding with glass. In many areas, it’s a two-pronged problem: Light pollution attracts and disorients migratory birds, most of which travel at night; in the morning, birds collide with reflective glass that hasn’t been made bird-friendly.\n\nWhile many people assume this is a city problem—what with all those city lights and gleaming glass spires—a landmark 2014 study on bird collisions reached a surprising conclusion. The authors estimate that of those birds killed annually by building collisions, roughly 44% of those deaths occurred at residences, 56% at low-rises, and less than 1% at high-rises. Residences were defined as one to three stories tall, low-rises as four to 11 stories tall, and high-rise buildings as 12 stories or higher.\nHigh-Rises Versus Low-Rises and Houses\nGiven the attention given to bird collisions in cities—full disclosure: I’ve personally documented over 1,300 migratory songbird collisions in New York City since the fall of 2020!—it's easy to direct our focus toward urban centers. And how bad could houses be?\n\nWell, each individual residence or low-rise building may kill just a handful of birds each year, but there are so many of these buildings that the full toll is devastating. \nAs the 2014 study authors write: “... a large proportion of all mortality occurs at structures that kill small numbers of birds on a per-building basis but collectively constitute a high percentage of all buildings.”\n\nMark of bird flying into glass\nA bird print is tell-tale sign that one has hit your window. CG6 Images / Getty Images\nThey go on to note that this finding suggests that “achieving a large overall reduction in mortality will require mitigation measures to be applied across a large number of structures.”\n\nOften when I talk about my experience of rescuing and recovering window-collision victims in the city, people tell me the sad stories of a bird here or there hitting their windows at their home or low-rise apartment. This is it. This is what is killing millions of birds a year. Finding a few handfuls of birds a year at home may not seem significant, but it is.\n\nIn a way, skyscrapers are an easier fix. While overall, they kill fewer birds, each building with a bird problem has a much higher mortality rate than residences and low-rises overall. Meaning that mitigating the glass at the most lethal high-rises could have a big impact. \n\nBut reducing mortality rates at residences remains of critical importance. Because even if every problematic high-rise were made bird-friendly, we’d still have the rest of the buildings continuing to kill birds. If we have 142 million houses in the U.S., and each one kills just five birds a year, that’s more than 700 million birds. You can see how this is a problem.\n\nWhy Do Bird-Window Collisions Matter?\nA 2019 study published in Science found that since 1970, bird populations in the United States and Canada declined by 29%, or almost 3 billion birds, “signaling a widespread ecological crisis.” \n\n“Multiple, independent lines of evidence show a massive reduction in the abundance of birds,” said Ken Rosenberg, the study’s lead author and a senior scientist at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and American Bird Conservancy. “We expected to see continuing declines of threatened species. But for the first time, the results also showed pervasive losses among common birds across all habitats, including backyard birds.”\n\nOf course, this is a blow to bird lovers … and anyone who cares about nature and wildlife in general. But it goes so far beyond that. Birds provide an extraordinary array of ecosystem services, from seeding forests and scavenging waste to pest control. (Did you know that globally, birds eat 400 to 500 million metric tonnes of insects per year? Their value to agriculture runs in the billions of dollars.) Birds are vital to the mechanics of life on Earth.\nThe Problem With Birds and Glass\nBeautiful modern house in the forest, outdoor\njnnault / Getty Images\nBirds don’t understand the concept of windows–and when they see habitat and sky reflected in the glass, they fly full-speed into it. In other areas, they may be able to see through the glass and try to reach what they see beyond, which could be indoor plants or another window with the outdoors beyond it. Either way, colliding with glass is often instantly deadly, thanks to head trauma and internal injuries.\n\nIf a bird does not die upon impact, it may remain stunned on the ground and become the plaything of a cat or the meal of a predator. If a bird does eventually recover from the initial impact, it may fly off to a tree. Unfortunately, up to 74% of birds will succumb later to their injuries if not treated by a wildlife rehabilitator. Of the window-collision birds I find in New York City, about 30% of the birds I find survive the initial collision—even though I get those rescues to the wildlife clinic as soon as I can, only about half of those ones survive. \nWhere to Find a Wildlife Rehabber\nThe most important thing you can do for a bird that has collided with a window is to bring it to a wildlife rehabber. Even if a bird looks only stunned and can still fly, most will succumb to their injuries. Please visit Animal Help Now to find the closest wildlife rehabilitater to you.\n\nIf You Have Bird Feeders or Native Plants\nIf you use bird feeders or have native plants that are attractive to birds, it is your responsibility not to kill the birds that you are actively attracting to your home. \n\nHouses with bird feeders near windows have significantly more collisions; current advice is to keep birders three feet or closer to a window (or beyond 30 feet) to reduce window collisions. But unless you treat your windows with one of the methods below, they will still be deadly. \n\nMake Your Windows Bird-Friendly\nIt might be that you have one or two windows with just the right dynamics to make them lethal to birds; maybe you have more. Regardless, there are many, many things you can do to make them safe for our feathered friends. The main idea is to break up the reflection the birds are flying into and/or alert them that glass is there and they can’t fly through it.\nThe American Bird Conservancy has a fantastic database of products and is a comprehensive resource for ways to prevent birds from colliding with your windows. People are attached to their big picture windows with unobstructed views; most of these will maintain the view. Here are a few options.\nGrid Patterns\n\nThe glass needs a pattern on the outside with spaces no more than 2 inches between elements, for example, a grid made of dots. This can be a residential decal product or even just paint that you apply yourself. Feather Friendly makes a great DIY decal, and it’s highly effective. \n\nStripes and Horizontal Patterns\n\nA horizontal pattern will work as well, with the stripes being no farther than two inches apart. Another horizontal product is Acopian BirdSavers, which are basically cords that hang in front of your window. These can be purchased, or you can easily make them yourself (see video above). ABC BirdTape is another great option that is easy to install yourself.\nTemporary Painted Patterns\n\nPainting patterns with tempera on the outside of problematic windows is a fun approach. It's cheap and the paint can be washed away during off-season, as long as your regular birds are not colliding. You can even just recreate a dot pattern with tempera paint, just remember to keep dots no more than two inches apart.\n\nScreens\nWindow screens do double duty for keeping insects out and reducing collisions by adding a visual deterrent and also providing a softer surface for a bird to bounce against.\n\nLet Your Windows Be Dirty\nLeaving your windows dirty (or making them dirty with soap) actually works really well to prevent collisions! And how nice to have an excuse to not have to clean them ... right?\n\nFor more on making your windows safe for birds, see NYC Audubon's guide to bird-friendly windows.\n\nWhat Doesn't Work to Prevent Bird Collisions\nDecals of birds of prey are not effective unless they are placed no more than two inches apart from each other. \n\nResearch has shown the following collision-deterrent strategies to be mostly or entirely ineffective:\n\nSilhouette decals of any shape unless multiple decals are applied in a pattern two inches apart\nUV decals or liquid, which are not visible to all bird species and are least visible early in the morning, when most collisions occur\nRibbons or string spaced too far apart\nTreatments applied to the inside of windows\nNoise deterrents\nPlastic owls\nDim Your Interior and Exterior Lights During Peak Seasons\nMost migrating birds travel at night, and many use visual clues to navigate–including stars, the moon, and the setting/rising sun. Additionally, like moths (although scientists don’t know exactly why), birds are drawn to light. Artificial lights confuse them, often leading them to become disoriented and exhausted and use up valuable resources they need for the arduous task of migration. Dimming (or better yet, turning off) lights during peak migration can do a world of good. Spring migration peaks from the third week of April to mid-May; fall migration is longer, running from late August to mid-November. You can use the amazing tools at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology’s BirdCast to see migration forecasts for your area.\nEven if you can’t turn off all of your lights, focus on dimming exterior lights. Pay attention to floodlights that face upwards and lights that illuminate broad swaths. Adding motion sensors to these lights is a great way to reduce light pollution without compromising the need for illumination when someone is present.\n\nCheck the International Dark Sky Association, which has more information on outdoor lighting basics.\nKeep Cats Indoors\nAnd while we are at it, outdoor cats are an invasive species that kill up to three billion birds a year in the U.S., more than any other cause, even windows. Indoor cats live longer, healthier lives when they are kept indoors—a fact with science to back it up. When cats are allowed to roam outside, they run a high risk of picking up pathogens and facing threats from vehicle collisions, being hunted by other predators, and maybe even ingesting poison put out for rats or other animals. For anyone who wants to share their outdoor space with cats, consider a catio or harness.\n\nIf You Find a Stunned or Injured Bird\nA sunned northern parula warbler\nA northern parula showing signs of injury after colliding with a window in NYC.\nMelissa Breyer\n\nIf you find a bird that doesn't fly away when you approach, something is likely wrong. Especially if it is near a window. If it is hunched, has its eyes closed or squinting, is looking up toward the sky, has its mouth open, or is panting, it is definitely in distress and needs care. Any bird that has collided with a window needs to be seen by a licensed wildlife rehabilitator. (Again, to find a wildlife rehabber near you, use the Animal Help Now wildlife rehab finder.)\n\nIf you can pick up the bird, this is not the time for photos and a Disney princess moment—sorry to be a sourpuss! But a window-collision bird is already very stressed, and interaction with a predator, no matter how softly the human may be cooing, significantly compounds the stress. Do not pet it, do not talk to it—it needs a dark, quiet place, stat. A brown paper bag with a binder clip works perfectly, or a covered box. Do not give it food or water.",

      "blog_post": "It’s here. After months of flirting with warmer weather in the Northern Hemisphere, June is finally here to welcome back BBQs, sunscreen, water balloons, firepits, camping, gardening, and everything else warm-weather delicious, fragrant, and visually arresting. Depending on where you live, it’s also one of the few times of the year when the stars above face some fierce competition from the fireflies below. Welcome back, nature—we’ve missed you. \n\nIn celebration, check out some of June’s nighttime (and even daytime) highlights below. Wishing you clear skies! \n\nImagine the Beauty of the Arietids Meteor Shower (June 7) \nWith a peak display of more than 60 shooting stars each hour, the Arietids are one of the best meteor showers of the year. There's only one problem: they're nearly impossible to see. Unlike the Leonids or the Perseids, the Arietids are one of a few meteor showers that peak during daylight hours.\n\nDespite the sun obscuring much of the Arietids' fiery display, there's still a chance to catch some before sunrise on the mornings of June 7 and 8. And if waking up early to see shooting stars is disagreeable, why not try hearing them? The Arietids are also known as a \"radio shower\" due to the way their intense speed (upwards of 75,000 mph) through Earth's atmosphere creates whining radar echoes. According to NASA, you can listen to them burning up by simply using a ham radio.\n\nView the Sweet Beauty of the Super Strawberry Moon (June 4) \nJune’s full moon, nicknamed the “Strawberry Moon’’ after the ripening crops of the eponymous sweet fruit, will reach its peak at 11:43 p.m. EDT on June 4. Alternative nicknames for the month’s full moon include the honey and/or mead moon (so named for the spring crop of honey gathered from European honeybees) and the blooming moon or green corn moon. \n\nWake Up and Enjoy the Earliest Sunrise of the Year (June 14) \nWhile the summer solstice on June 21 is the longest day of the year, it's not the one with the earliest sunrise. What gives? There are a variety of factors that influence this quirk involving the speed and slightly elliptical path of Earth's orbit around the sun and the tilt of its axis. The math all adds up to make the earliest sunrise about a week before the summer solstice and the latest sunset about a week after. The exact date of this depends on what latitude you reside on. So, for instance, if you reside in the mid-northern latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, or Boulder, Colorado), you could expect the earliest sunrise of the year to occur on June 14 at 5:31 a.m. Either way, it’s a great excuse to grab a cup of coffee, sit outside, and revel in the impending return to summer. \nJune’s New Moon Welcomes Dark Skies (June 18)\nThanks to a late New Moon on May 30, June will kick off with some exceptionally dark skies. For the first week at least, you can train your eyes, binoculars, or telescope and be treated to pristine views of galaxies, shooting stars, and other wonders otherwise dimmed by moonlight. \n\nPinwheel galaxy with a supernova highlighted\nThe new supernova in the Pinwheel Galaxy.\nFlorian Runger / Wikimedia Commons / CC 4.0\n\n Need a target? This month, in honor of summer’s official arrival and the discovery of a new supernova, we’re recommending The Pinwheel Galaxy (M101). Discovered in 1781 by Pierre Méchain, and located some 21 million light-years from Earth, this face-on spiral galaxy stretches 170,000 light-years across (our own Milky Way, by comparison, spans an estimated 100,000-120,000 light-years) and contains around a trillion stars. On May 19, 2023, a Type II supernova was observed occurring within the Pinwheel Galaxy, the first from that region since 2011. With the New Moon removing troublesome moonlight, you should be able to easily spot the new supernova with a small telescope. \n\n Why Dark Skies Matter\nWelcome the Summer Solstice & Longest Day (June 21)\nThe summer solstice, the astronomical start of summer in the Northern Hemisphere (and conversely, the start of winter in the Southern), will occur on June 21 at 10:57 a.m. At this moment, the Earth will be at the point in its orbit where the North Pole is at its maximum tilt. For those of us up North, this gives us our longest day of the year with anywhere from 13 hours and 45 minutes (Miami, Florida) to 19 hours and 21 minutes (Anchorage, Alaska) of daylight. With the Sun directly overhead at noon, it’s also the day that you’ll cast your shortest shadow. After the 21st, we’ll once again start losing daylight and begin the long march back toward the darker days of winter—so enjoy it while you can! And just after the sun sets…\n\nLook West To View A Celestial Trio of Mars, Venus, and the Crescent Moon (June 21)\nDark sky with Mars, Moon, and Venus\nStellarium\n\nWhile Venus will put on a show after sunset all month long, it will be joined by a thin crescent moon and Mars during dusk on the evening of June 21. Cap off the longest day of the year by watching this trio welcome the shortest evening of the year. \n\nGrab a Drink, Relax, and Enjoy the Year’s Latest Sunset (June 27) \nJune 27th, for us northern dwellers, marks the year’s latest sunset, with locations like New York City watching the sun slip below the horizon at 8:31 p.m. EDT. While you’re at it, stay up a few more hours to….\n\nCatch the Bootid Meteor Shower (June 27)\nDark sky with an outline of the constellation Bootes\nLook to the western horizon a little after midnight on June 27 to spy some Bootids.\nStellarium\n\nThe end of June brings the return of the Bootids meteor shower, an annual event that (thankfully) can be enjoyed during the evening hours. Well, \"enjoyed\" may not be the right word, as the Bootids are notorious for having extremely weak displays, with as little as two to three shooting stars per hour. The reason they're worth mentioning at all is because some years, they've littered the sky with streaks of light.\n\n On June 27, 1998, as many as 100 meteors per hour fell over the course of the seven-hour event. According to Spaceweather, similar outbursts occurred in 1916, 1921, and 1927. Could 2023 join that historic group? To give the Bootids a shot, look towards the constellation Bootes, which lies to the left of the Little Dipper.\n\nWhy Does Treehugger Cover Space?\nSpace is our planet’s home, and its wonders help us get outside and foster an appreciation of nature. Exploring space and the cosmos can also help us learn about what’s happening on Earth. Space-based technologies have helped us better understand climate change, water cycles, and even air quality.",

      "blog_post": "Oppenheimer is a sumptuous drama from one of our finest directors working at the top of his game—but there's only so much information you can pack into a three-hour movie. The movie entertains and makes you feel dumb in almost equal measure, making it hard to escape the basic takeaway that we probably should know a lot more: About this guy, the Cold War, the birth of the Atomic Age, and quantum physics in general. And while you can (and should) head straight to Wikipedia, the real lore is in books and documentaries, and here are 11 to get you started. \n\nAmerican Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer\nAt the risk of being painfully obvious, the book on which the movie was based seems a logical place to start. Written by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, it was published in 2005 and went on to win the Pulitzer Prize. Nolan reportedly began adapting it after Robert Pattinson gave him a collection of Oppenheimer’s speeches as a parting gift when the two finished Tenet. (It would’ve been called “Oppie” if not for a last-minute veto from an editor.)\n\nThe Making Of The Atomic Bomb\nThe other big book on the subject, from Richard Rhodes, published in 1987, which also won the Pulitzer Prize. Focused more on the general history of the bomb than on Oppenheimer himself, Rhodes relied heavily on lengthy interviews with the scientists and engineers of Los Alamos.\n\nBrotherhood of the Bomb: The Tangled Lives and Loyalties of Robert Oppenheimer, Ernest Lawrence, and Edward Teller\nLess well-known than Rhodes or Bird and Sherwin’s books, UC Merced historian Gregg Herken received a MacArthur Grant to write this history of the nuclear age, told through the three titular personalities, Oppenheimer, Lawrence, and Teller—who you may now know as Cillian Murphy, Josh Hartnett, and Benny Safdie.\n\nThe Day After Trinity\nFor those of us who prefer watching to reading, there’s Jon Else’s Oscar-nominated 1981 documentary about Oppenheimer’s anti-proliferation advocacy. 40-year-old documentaries can be tough to find these days, but this one is luckily available from the Criterion Channel. “Through extensive interviews and archival footage, The Day After Trinity traces Oppenheimer’s evolution, from architect of one of the most consequential endeavors of the twentieth century to an outspoken opponent of nuclear proliferation who came to deeply regret his role in ushering in the perils of the atomic age.”\n\nAmerican Experience: The Trials Of J. Robert Oppenheimer\nAlso in the documentary department, there’s PBS’s 2009 re-enactment-style documentary about Oppenheimer and the subsequent battles over his communist affiliations, produced as part of the \"American Experience\" series, starring David Straithairn as Oppenheimer. Directed by David Grubin, it’s about as straightforward a telling of some of the background information covered in the film as you’ll find. (It’s also available on Apple TV.)\n\nHiroshima\nJohn Hershey’s 30,000-some word report focusing on six survivors of the first atomic bomb exploded on a civilian population initially took up an entire issue of the New Yorker in the summer of 1946, and was turned into a book soon after. It’s one of the most famous pieces of journalism ever, to the point that it spawned an entire book about the making of it – Fallout: The Hiroshima Cover-up and the Reporter Who Revealed It to the World, by Leslie M.M. Blume. Chances are you’ve already heard of Hiroshima, but the perspective it offers from the bomb’s actual victims is the mandatory counterpart to any Oppenheimer viewing.\n\nFive Days in August: How World War II Became a Nuclear War\nIf Oppenheimer advances (somewhat) the traditional narrative that the A-Bomb was the revolutionary weapon that ended the war, Princeton historian Michael D. Gordin presented a counter-interpretation in his 2007 book that “the military did not clearly understand the atomic bomb’s revolutionary strategic potential, that the Allies were almost as stunned by the surrender as the Japanese were by the attack, and that not only had experts planned and fully anticipated the need for a third bomb, they were skeptical about whether the atomic bomb would work at all.” \n\nIn the Matter of J. Robert Oppenheimer: The Security Clearance Hearing\nIf the race to beat the Germans to developing the atomic bomb is the obvious cinematic center of Oppenheimer, Nolan devotes a surprising portion of the film and especially the last hour to the 1953 hearings over Oppenheimer’s security clearance, which was denied over his alleged communist ties (and, according to the film, all spearheaded by Oppenheimer’s nemesis, Atomic Energy Commissioner Lewis Strauss, played by Robert Downey Jr.). In this volume, Cornell historian Richard Polenberg drew on annotated transcripts of the hearing and Oppenheimer's subsequent appeal, as well as declassified FBI files, to create a portrait of the Cold War atmosphere of the time and what the hearing's outcome meant for Oppenheimer and for the world. \n\n“The Ambivalence of J. Robert Oppenheimer” (Esquire, 1983)\n“Oppie's Problem” (New York Review of Books, 2023)\nIf Oppenheimer presents a fairly sympathetic portrait of Robert Oppenheimer in his relationships to his left-wing friends, this pair of articles from Esquire and the New York Review of Books are… less sympathetic. The former also offers detailed interpretations of Oppenheimer’s conflict with Strauss. \n\nCosmic Banditos\nOppenheimer opens with its subject trying to understand, and then teach, the truly strange and seemingly paradoxical science of quantum physics. Certainly there are more scholarly works on the subject, but probably there exists no goofier introduction to subatomics than AC Weisbecker’s 1986 cult semi-autobiographical novel about a pot smuggler who becomes obsessed with quantum physics and his dog. The easiest way to learn something is by accident, and it doesn’t get more accidental than this footnote-heavy farce.",

      "blog_post": "Stable Diffusion, introduced in 2022, is a deep learning model that excels in converting text descriptions into rich, detailed images. Its primary function revolves around generating images based on textual inputs, but it also possesses the capability to tackle diverse tasks like inpainting, outpainting, and generating image-to-image transformations with the guidance of textual prompts.\n\nStable Diffusion’s Architecture\nStable Diffusion utilizes a specific type of diffusion model known as a latent diffusion model (LDM), which was developed by the CompVis group at LMU Munich. Diffusion models, introduced in 2015, are trained with the objective of removing Gaussian noise applied to training images, akin to a sequence of denoising autoencoders. Stable Diffusion comprises three main components: a variational autoencoder (VAE), U-Net, and an optional text encoder.\n\nThe VAE encoder compresses the image from pixel space into a lower-dimensional latent space, capturing a more fundamental semantic meaning of the image. During forward diffusion, Gaussian noise is iteratively applied to the compressed latent representation. The U-Net block, incorporating a ResNet backbone, denoises the output from forward diffusion to reconstruct a latent representation. Finally, the VAE decoder converts the representation back into pixel space to generate the final image.\n\nThe denoising step can be conditioned on various factors, such as text, images, or other modalities. Conditioning data is incorporated into denoising U-Nets using a cross-attention mechanism. When text is used for conditioning, the pretrained CLIP ViT-L/14 text encoder is employed to transform text prompts into an embedding space. Researchers highlight the computational efficiency of LDMs for training and generation compared to other models.\n\nStable Diffusion is considered relatively lightweight, following 2022 standards, with approximately 860 million parameters in the U-Net and 123 million parameters in the text encoder. Unlike other diffusion models, it can run on consumer GPUs, providing practical accessibility.\n\nStable Diffusion’s limitations\nStable Diffusion exhibits certain limitations and challenges in specific scenarios. In its initial releases, the model was trained on a dataset comprising 512×512 resolution images. Consequently, when users deviate from this “expected” resolution, the quality of generated images noticeably degrades. However, the version 2.0 update introduced the capability to generate images natively at a higher resolution of 768×768.\n\nAnother challenge arises in generating human limbs due to the poor quality of limb data in the LAION database. The model lacks sufficient training to understand human limbs and faces due to the absence of representative features in the database. Consequently, generating images of this nature can confuse the model.\n\nAccessibility for individual developers can also pose a problem. To customize the model for new use cases that are not covered by the dataset, additional data and further training are necessary. Fine-tuned adaptations of Stable Diffusion have been employed in various applications, from medical imaging to algorithmically generated music. However, this fine-tuning process is sensitive to the quality of the new data. Low-resolution or non-matching resolution images can fail to learn the new task and even degrade the overall performance of the model. Furthermore, running models on consumer electronics can be challenging. For instance, the “waifu-diffusion” training process requires a minimum of 30 GB of VRAM, surpassing the typical resources provided in consumer GPUs such as Nvidia’s GeForce 30 series, which typically offer around 12 GB.\n\nThe creators of Stable Diffusion acknowledge the potential for algorithmic bias, as the model was primarily trained on images accompanied by English descriptions. Consequently, the generated images tend to reinforce social biases and reflect a Western perspective. The model produces more accurate results for prompts written in English compared to those in other languages, with Western or White cultures often being default representations.\n\nThe creators note that the model lacks data from other communities and cultures.\n\nStable Diffusion is written in Python.",

      "blog_post": "TL;DR\nMarination has two basic functions. It acts as a brine as salt in the marinade penetrates the meat and seasons it more fully, helping to ensure juiciness even after cooking; the ideal marination time for the brining effect is between one and eight hours. Marinades otherwise are just a surface treatment, adding flavor and enhancing browning, though this is a benefit that does not improve over time as the marinade will not penetrate the meat in a significant way. Lastly, tenderizers like acids, bases, and enzymes can have beneficial effects, though they can also lead to poor texture and flavor if used in too high a concentration or if left on the meat for too long.\n\nEvery year as grilling season rolls around, dads, moms, and general appreciators of summer cookouts knock the rust off their Webers, oil their grates, and gingerly navigate their home’s outdoor fire code. And for those who enjoy meat (and even those who don’t), many are making and using marinades to add flavor and improve texture and juiciness.\n\nBut questions about marinades linger. What are the essential elements of a marinade? What exactly does a marinade accomplish? How long should you marinate for? Is it true that marinades are just \"surface treatments\" that don't penetrate deeply? Are all acids in a marinade harmful to the texture of proteins if left for too long? And, are marinades even worth it?\n\nAs with most things, there's no easy answer to any of this, as it depends both on the marinade and the type of food being marinated. While this article can't account for every possible variable, we can look at some of the biggest factors. There's plenty we can learn by examining the basic science of marination as well as running tests of our own to better understand what happens when foods are marinated.\n\nUnderstanding how marinades function isn't just an academic matter—it can influence how we concoct marinades and how we apply them. Since the whole point of marination is to enhance the foods we cook, we might as well make sure we're getting the best possible result when doing it. The time to submerge ourselves in the topic is now.\n\nWhat is Marination?\nMarination is a broad term, but the crux of it involves soaking some food in a flavorful liquid before you cook it, usually for anywhere from 30 minutes to 24 hours.\n\nA basic marinade will contain some combination of the following:\n\nWater: Water can come in the form of juice, wine or beer, a condiment like soy sauce, or just straight-up water.\nSalt: Essential for basic seasoning and moisture retention*, salt can come from condiments or pure salt.\nSugar: Whether refined, raw, brown, or in the form of a sweet ingredient like honey, sugar seasons the exterior of meats and enhances browning and caramelization.\nAromatics: These might include herbs, spices, fresh aromatics like garlic and ginger, or even fruit rinds.\nFat: Liquid fats such as olive oil, vegetable oil, and even sesame oil are added for flavoring; they also conduct heat more efficiently than water, so the surface of meat may cook faster when fat is present.\nAcid/Base/Enzyme: These ingredients alter the texture of meat by denaturing or digesting proteins like actin, myosin, or collagen; these effects can be pronounced depending on the concentration of the additive and the amount of marination time you choose.\n*Salt partially dissolves proteins in meat (primarily myosin, which is responsible for muscle contraction), such that those proteins don’t contract as much when cooked. If the proteins don’t contract as much, the meat holds onto more water, so it tastes juicier and more tender. For a detailed explanation, read Kenji’s primer on brining here.\n\nWhy Marinate?\nWith respect to meat proteins, the common reasoning looks something like this: \n\nMarinating seasons the meat, primarily via salt.\nMarinating sometimes enhances the exterior of meat by promoting browning.\nMarinating keeps (or makes) meat tender when cooked.\nMarinating flavors meat via aromatics, spices, or other ingredients.\nNow let’s be real: Those are all broad claims. So we’ll start with what we know with certainty. \n\nYes, marinating seasons meat protein via salt, and it does so effectively. We know this because osmosis and the diffusion of salt in proteins is a proven process. Heck, we have entire guides dedicated to brining and dry brining; brining, after all, is exactly what salt in a marinade is doing. I’d even go so far as to say that the most important ingredient in any marinade is salt, period. So no disputes there.\n\nAnd for sure, marinating can enhance the exterior of meat by promoting browning. Many marinades contain sugar (in the form of sucrose, fructose, even glucose), which promotes browning and caramelization (see: the Maillard reaction and caramelization). In these cases, a nice crust or char can form on the surface of meat, which can have a pleasing effect on both texture and flavor.\n\nBut what about those last two claims about marination improving tenderness and flavor? The answer to whether those are true, unfortunately, is: It depends. And to really unpack those ideas, we have to start asking more specific questions. \n\nHere are some questions that can help us more fully explore those claims:\n\nDoes time in a marinade matter? \nDo seasonings other than salt make a difference in flavor, especially at the interior of the meat being marinated?\nDoes fat make a difference in flavor, including at the interior? \nDo acids, bases, or enzymes make a difference in the meat's texture and quality?\nQuestion 1: Does Time in a Marinade Matter? (Answer: Yes)\nPeople have all sorts of opinions on how long you should marinate meat. Two hours, 6 hours, 48 hours, exactly 18 minutes—and those recommendations often get downright Draconian in their reasoning. While I can't tell you how long you should soak your meat in the marinade you might be using right now, I can show you some trends by employing some basic testing.\n\nTo answer this question, I mixed a basic marinade of soy sauce, water, sugar, grated garlic, and vegetable oil (in a ratio of 4:3:2:1:0.5 by weight). I poured a measured amount of this mixture into separate bags containing 3-ounce samples of chicken breast, pork tenderloin, and flank steak, and marinated each sample for varying durations (0 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 4 hours, 8 hours, 24 hours). I staggered each test so that I could cook each sample at the same time and compare them fairly.\n\nYou may ask, why no acid in this marinade? Firstly, soy sauce is slightly acidic (around 5.0 pH). Plus, the inclusion of stronger acids or bases (or enzymes) in a marinade drastically complicates our ability to assess effects of base ingredients like salt, sugar, or aromatics. For more on acids, bases, and enzymes, see the relevant section below.\n\nHere’s chicken breast (1-inch thickness) marinated at various times, prior to cooking:\n\nOverhead view of raw chicken\nSerious East / Tim Chin\nNot much to note here visually, but I did notice that the 24-hour sample felt noticeably firmer than the other samples—almost like a gummy bear.\n\nHere are the same samples of chicken breast after cooking in a carbon steel skillet to an internal temperature of 150°F:\n\nOverhead view of cooked chicken\nSerious Eats / Tim Chin\nAnd some selected cross-sections for good measure:\n\nCross section of chicken\nSerious Eats / Tim Chin\nGeneral Observations for Chicken\n\nFour-, 8-, and 24-hour samples were more deeply seasoned (saltier) than all the other samples, with the 30-minute sample tasting least seasoned.\nThere was visible caramelization and char on samples marinated for at least one hour, with 8- and 24-hour samples showing the most intense coloration.\nThe 24-hour sample was moist, but also rubbery and ham-like. There was an unpleasant springiness to the meat when chewed—almost crunchy between the teeth.\nTasters preferred the 1- to 8-hour samples, with slight preference to the 4-hour sample for its perceived balance of seasoning, tenderness, and juiciness.\nZero- and 30-minute samples showed virtually no seasoning at the interior; they tasted drier and less succulent than longer-marinated samples\nNext is the same test with samples of pork tenderloin and flank steak.\n\nPork tenderloin (1-inch thickness), cooked to 140°F and rested:\n\nRaw pork\nSerious East / Tim Chin\nCooked prok\nSerious Eats / Tim Chin\n \nCross section \nSerious Eats / Tim Chin\nGeneral Observations for Pork\n\nUnlike the chicken samples, the 24-hour marinated pork did not taste over-cured or overly chewy; it was moist and well seasoned.\nThe 0-minute, 30-minute, and 1-hour samples were relatively unseasoned in comparison to the longer-marinated samples; they were also less juicy.\nIt seems that pork tenderloin holds up better to longer marination than chicken breast.\nFlank steak (3/4-inch thickness), cooked to 125 degrees and rested:\n\nRaw beef\nTim Chin / Serious Eats\nCooked Beef\nSerious Eats / Tim Chin\n \nCooked beef Cross section\nSerious Eats / Tim Chin\nGeneral Observations for Beef\n\nThe best tasting samples came at the 4-hour mark and longer, with slight preference for the 8-hour flank steak.\nThe 24-hour marinated sample did not taste gummy, crunchy or over-cured.\nThe Bottom Line\nTime in a marinade definitely matters as far as its brining effect is concerned. In general, longer marination results in deeper seasoning, better moisture retention, and increased levels of browning or char (provided that there is sugar in the marinade). But we can’t necessarily make firm conclusions on optimal timing; it depends on the meat you are using, the pH of your marinade (read Question 4 below), and even your personal preference for seasoning. But using a relatively inert marinade for poultry and red meats, there seems to be a window between 1 hour and 8 hours where the benefits of seasoning and moisture retention are greatest. For chicken breast, the meat can over-cure and become almost crunchy if you marinate it too long; for beef and pork, you’ve got some more wiggle room. Do note, though: A marinade with an acid, base, or enzyme would drastically affect this timing as well.\n\nIn contrast, shorter times in a marinade don’t deliver much of a payoff in terms of deep seasoning (or even surface seasoning) or moisture retention. It seems that there isn’t enough time for the marinade to adhere and penetrate even the first millimeter of meat. But keep in mind, this testing didn’t include more delicate proteins like fish, shrimp, or lobster—which have slightly different protein structures and permeability (so a shorter marination time may be adequate in those cases).\nQuestion 2: Do Seasonings Other Than Salt Make a Difference in Flavor? (Answer: Maybe)\nKenji has written at length about skipping aromatics in a brine. The reason? Salt is a small molecule that passes easily through the semipermeable membrane of meat tissue; aromatics like pepper and garlic are much bigger molecules. Salt is also a highly charged molecule, so water in and around meat is more attracted to it than less-charged (non-polar) molecules.\n\nBut sound reasoning aside, people still put all kinds of flavorings and aromatics in their marinades—garlic, sugar, liquid smoke, bouillon powder, bay leaves, citrus rinds, the list is never-ending. And certainly, these ingredients contribute to the flavor of the exterior of the meat. After all, what would a dish like beef galbi be without the charred, smoky, sweet-savory flavor that results from the combination of asian pear, garlic, and various aromatics hitting a hot grill?\n\nBut do these seasonings truly penetrate beyond the surface? Just to be thorough, I performed some basic tests.\n\nBelow are six samples of chicken breast, each treated with a different seasoning in a 10-percent salt brine: sugar, MSG, grated garlic*, pepper, cumin, and five-spice seasoning. I marinated each sample for 8 hours and then cooked the chicken sous vide in a 150°F water bath for one hour. For comparison’s sake, I also repeated the test without salt (0-percent brine).  \n\nI evaluated each sample for flavor penetration by cutting off the outermost 2 millimeters of meat on all sides, compared against a control sample of “unflavored” (salt brine–only) chicken, as well as a completely unseasoned sample.\n\nVarious seasoning \nSerious Eats / Tim Chin\nGeneral Observations\n\nFor pepper and cumin, there was no detectable flavor penetration; I couldn’t taste any spice at the interior.\nGarlic and five-spice seasoning showed the faintest hint of seasoning in the interior, but it was almost imperceptible compared to the unseasoned control sample.\nThe flavor of sugar-treated chicken was mostly salty at the interior; there was little to no detectable sweetness.\nThe MSG sample showed the greatest transformation: very umami, with a ham-like flavor and texture.\nI selected these seasonings based on a couple premises: A) Molecular weight correlates loosely with degree of permeability through meat since smaller molecules can generally pass through that semipermeable membrane more easily, and B) molecules that dissociate in water into ions can permeate meat tissue to an extent.\n\nSugar is a huge molecule (342.3 g/mol, compared to salt’s 58.44 g/mol) that doesn’t dissociate into ions in water. It’s far too big to penetrate meat tissue—which we observe in testing. Similarly, piperine, the compound responsible for the pungency of black pepper, is another large molecule (285.35 g/mol) with no magnetic charge—and we don’t taste it in the interior either. Cuminaldehyde, the aromatic oil responsible for cumin’s flavor, is also pretty large (148.21 g/mol), so it should not season meat deeply.\n\nThe results for garlic and five-spice seasoning were unexpected, though. Both garlic's allicin (162.28 g/mol) and five-spice's eugenol (164.2 g/mol; one of the molecules responsible for the flavor of clove and cinnamon) are relatively large molecules compared to salt. We wouldn’t expect much flavor penetration based on our initial premise, but I did detect the faintest hint. It could be that these molecules are slightly more polar (charged) than, say, cuminaldehyde or piperine, so they may be able to reasonably pass through that semipermeable membrane. But that’s just an educated guess at best.\n\nFinally, the MSG sample gave the most surprising result. MSG has molecular weight (169.11 g/mol) similar to allicin or eugenol, but it readily dissociates in water into sodium and glutamate ions. The charged nature of this molecule probably makes it easier to pass through meat tissue, and we may have observed this in testing: The MSG sample seemed almost like cured ham, with a distinct savory flavor. \nThe Bottom Line\nBeyond the surface of meat, it seems like for the most part, they do not. If you truly want your seasonings to penetrate to the interior of your meat, you might choose ingredients with flavor molecules that are smaller, and preferably ones that can dissociate in water into smaller, charged ions. Or you might consider manipulating the meat itself: Cutting it smaller for increased surface area, injecting a marinade into it, or pounding or roughly massaging it to break up muscle tissue might help a marinade penetrate more deeply.\nQuestion 3: Does Fat Improve Flavor Inside the Meat? (Answer: Not Really, But You Should Still Use It)\nYou’ve probably heard the cook’s adage: Fat carries flavor. After all, how many recipes have you read that tell you to toast or “bloom” your spices in oil? Many flavor molecules are relatively nonpolar, meaning they don’t readily dissolve in water, but they do dissolve in fat or oil, which acts as a nonpolar solvent. So cooking your spices and aromatics in oil does tend to intensify their flavors. But the question remains: Can fat deliver those flavors deeper into meat?\n\nOverhead of cooked pork\nSerious Eats / Tim Chin\nI set up four samples of chicken breast using four different flavorings, and stirred each flavoring with a measured amount of vegetable oil. (None of these samples included salt or any other ingredients.) I marinated each sample for 8 hours and cooked them at 150°F for one hour. Concurrently, I repeated this test but briefly cooked the aromatics in oil by microwaving the mixtures for 2 minutes (until they were bubbly, slightly browned, and fragrant).\n\nGeneral Observations\n\nI didn’t detect flavor at the interior of any sample!\nThe Bottom Line\nFat doesn’t seem to “carry” flavor deeper into meat through marination. And if we think about this from a molecular perspective, this observation tracks. The permeability of meat to certain molecules largely depends on both their size and magnetic charge. Fats are large nonpolar molecules, and they lack charge, so they shouldn’t pass through meat very easily (if at all).\n\nSo why do so many cooks use oil in marinades? Despite their inability to transfer flavor into the meat, fats still deliver plenty of flavor to the surface. They also play double duty to conduct heat and lubricate food to keep it from sticking on a hot surface. But as far as adding flavor that you can detect through to the center of your meat? Don’t count on it. \n\nQuestion 4: Do Acids, Bases, or Enzymes Make a Difference in Texture or Quality? (Answer: Yes)\nIt’s common practice to add acids like lemon juice, vinegar, or buttermilk to marinades. These ingredients lower the pH of the mixture, which helps to denature proteins by changing their shape. In the best case, this denaturation can tenderize meat. Acids can also increase the water-holding capacity of meat. As Serious Eats contributor Nik Sharma explains in his exploration of the effects of different acids on meat texture, changing the shape of proteins exposes certain amino acids, which provides new opportunities to bind water. \n\nBut acids are just one player in a wider field of additives that can alter the texture and juiciness of meat. For example, there’s plenty of evidence to support the notion that raising the pH of a marinade (with say, baking soda or baking powder) also improves water-holding capacity. Why? High pH makes it harder for intramuscular proteins to associate and bond tightly when cooked; water gets trapped in the spaces between proteins, so the meat holds on to more water and stays juicy. Even Kenji stumbled upon this trick to keep shrimp plump and juicy. Finally, baking soda is a common addition to marinades in Chinese cooking—an essential step for velveting.\n\nApart from pH, we can also harness the power of enzymes—specifically proteases, such as those found in pineapples, to tenderize meat. Instead of denaturing (unfolding) proteins in the way that acids do, proteases cut proteins (like collagen) into smaller building blocks—the constituent amino acids. That means that proteins treated with protease tend to be very tender, almost falling apart in texture. Among proteases, bromelain (from pineapple), papain (from papaya), and ficin (from the fig tree) are some of the most common enzymes used to tenderize meat in industrial food preparations.\n\nTo illustrate and compare the differences between these treatments, I set up a basic test: 3 samples of chicken marinated for 8 hours each using a different “marinade”: a solution of 10-percent baking soda, a solution of 10-percent lactic acid, and pure pineapple juice (grated and strained from the core of a fresh pineapple*). I cooked each sample for one hour at 150°F in a sous-vide bath. I weighed each sample before marination, after marination, and after cooking to track any water loss. I also repeated this test with salt in each sample, and kept a control sample of plain, 10-percent brined chicken for comparison.\n\n*Canned pineapple fruit or juice does not contain any active bromelain. The easiest way to obtain bromelain is to juice a fresh pineapple, or grate the flesh.\n\nHere are the samples after 8 hours of marination:\n\nraw chicken\nSerious Eats / Tim Chin\nThe baking soda sample looks relatively raw in comparison; the lactic acid sample looks opaque, almost cooked at the exterior; the pineapple sample is slightly cooked but with visible striations in the meat that weren’t apparent at the start.\n\nHere are the same samples after cooking:\n\nGeneral Observations\n\nChicken tested three ways\nSerious Eats / Tim Chin\nAll samples were relatively tender compared to the untreated, 10-percent–brined chicken.\nLactic acid yielded the least tender meat, with a slightly “squeaky” texture between the teeth; the meat lost roughly 22 percent in water weight.\nPineapple gave the most tender, fall-apart texture; but the exterior was mushy, pasty, and categorically unappetizing. Total weight lost was 32 percent after cooking.\nBaking soda resulted in the juiciest meat by far. The texture was slightly less tender than pineapple. Total weight lost was 5 percent.\nOverall, all three methods showed a tenderizing effect. The most dramatic effect came from pineapple juice (bromelain), but it came at the cost of a nearly inedible exterior. This mushy, pasty quality is probably why most cooks recommend marinating in pineapple juice for shorter time periods—30 minutes to 4 hours at most.\n\nThe pineapple sample also showed the most water loss despite its fall-apart texture. \n\nPineapple marinade chicken\nSerious Eats / Tim Chin\nBaking soda produced the most striking result at the interior. Check this out:\n\nInside chicken\nSerious Eats / Tim Chin\nI didn’t poke those holes. Those gaps are likely evidence of proteins failing to bond and contract due to the elevated pH. Instead, water became trapped in these spaces, and I could see that water pressing out from these gaps as I sliced through the sample. But despite baking soda’s effectiveness, there was a drawback: Using such a high concentration of baking soda gave the chicken a metallic, ammonia-like aroma.\n\nThe Bottom Line:\nAcids, bases, and enzymes all work to tenderize or retain moisture in meat.\n\nEnzymes give a more fall-apart, broken-down interior, but don’t help meat retain ‘juiciness’;\nacids have a mild tenderizing effect and help to retain water; \nand bases seem to produce the juiciest, most plump interior.\nThe big caveat? Mind your concentrations of these additives as well as timing, since they can quickly transform the meat from palatable to mushy (bromelain), metallic tasting (baking soda), or inedible. Finally, don’t mix acids and bases in a marinade! They won’t work because they neutralize each other, so pick one or the other.\n\nConclusion: Is Marinating Worth It?\nAfter all this testing and research, we can (kinda, sorta) answer the question: Is marinating really worth your time? Well, yes, somewhat. But not for the reasons you may have thought. If you take away one idea from this article, it’s this: Marination is mostly a brine and otherwise a surface treatment. The benefits are maximized through cooking—over high heat, over a grill, in a hot oven. That cascade of flavors resulting from caramelization of sugars, and the heating of aromatics, spices, and fats all occur at the surface and maybe even the first millimeter of meat, though to be fair, those are all benefits that would also occur when a marinade is applied right before cooking. \n\nMarination is mostly not a method for injecting flavor into the interior of proteins. Beyond salt, and a select few ingredients like MSG, there are few ways to season the interior without resorting to physically manipulating the meat so that the marinade can penetrate, such as injecting flavorings with a syringe. And apart from flavor, if you really want to transform the interior texture of meats, consider adding an acid, base, or enzyme to your marinade.\n\nThere are still plenty of questions to ask here: Does marination work better for certain proteins, or certain thicknesses of meat? And how does marination affect vegetables? But for most marination scenarios, this guide is a good starting point, one that should give you enough information to help you navigate the ingredients and timing when marinating meats.",

      "blog_post": "\n\nFrom bright fuchsia sunsets to ballet-slipper blooms, Mother Nature seems to have a soft spot for pink. And the rosy displays don't just stop with astronomical events and flowers. All manner of creatures boast various shades of magenta, fuchsia, coral, and rose. Case in point? Consider these blushing beauties.\n1\nof 14\nRoseate Spoonbill\nRoseate spoonbills bathing\nArthur Morris / Getty Images\n\nWhile flamingos may be the poster children for pink animals, we couldn't pass up the beautifully quirky roseate spoonbill, a gorgeous pink wading bird with a charming spatulate bill. The color of the spoonbill results from its diet of crabs and shrimp.\n\nSadly for these exquisite creatures, their pink primary feathers were highly prized for use in ladies' fans in the late 19th century; by the 1930s, the once healthy Florida population had dipped to a total of only 30 to 40 breeding pairs. Fortunately, full legal protection against hunting was enacted, and there are now over 1,000 nesting pairs in Florida.\n2\nof 14\nPink Katydid\nPink Katydid walking on a vine\n\nHans Neleman / Getty Images\n\nFirst described in 1874, pink katydids have inspired more than a century of discussion over the hows and whys of their incredible hue. At the turn of the 20th century, Harvard entomologist Hubbard Scudder suggested that the pink coloring could be seasonal and that green insects changed their colors with the autumn leaves for protection.\n\nAmerican entomologist and myrmecologist William Morton Wheeler rejected this theory. Based on finding bright pink katydid nymphs in the prairies of Wisconsin and Illinois during July 1907, he suggested a genetic root to the condition. Wheeler compared the state to albinism. For the first time, pink katydids became recognized as genetic \"mutants\" in the scientific literature.1 Entomologists now believe they've confirmed that Wheeler was right. Whatever the reason, we're quite happy that there are such things as pink katydids in the world.\n3\nof 14\nBargibant's Pygmy Seahorse\nwhite seahorse with rounded belly and pink protrusions in near center of picture blending in with the pink fan coral it anchored to with tail\n\nGlen MacLarty / Flickr / CC BY 2.0\n\nTalk about blending in. Bargibant's seahorse (or pygmy seahorse) lives exclusively on fan corals and are such masters of disguise (hence their lovely hues that match the pink of the coral) that they went unnoticed until a researcher found one while studying coral in a lab. The nodules on the seahorse even match the buds on the coral. They comes from the family Syngnathidae and measure a mere 1/2 to 1 inch in length.\n4\nof 14\nWeb-Footed Gecko\nPalmatogecko (Pachydactylus rangei)\nfotoclick / Getty Images\n\nWeb-footed geckos can thank their strangely translucent, salmon-colored skin for hiding them so well against the reddish sands of the Namib Desert where they live. Additional defense mechanisms include a vocabulary of clicks, squeaks, croaks, and other sounds to scare off potential attackers. Not to mention the old \"break off the tail\" trick that all geckos have.\n\nBut perhaps the strangest thing about this reptile is that it does not have eyelids and thus must lick its eyeballs to keep them moist, proving that the animal world is stranger (and even more enjoyable) than fiction.\n5\nof 14\nOrchid Mantis\nClose-Up Of Orchid Mantis\nNurul Faridah / EyeEm / Getty Images\n\nIn 1879, Australian journalist James Hingsley returned from Indonesia with stories of a carnivorous pink orchid that lured butterflies to its petals and ate them alive. As you may have guessed, it wasn't a flower he saw; it was the amazingly deceptive flower-mimicking insect Hymenopus coronatus — the orchid mantis. In a more recent study to determine if the orchid mantis' fancy disguise lured insects to their deaths, scientists were surprised to find that the mantises attracted more insects than real flowers did.\n\nAnd while other animals may camouflage with flowers to hide among and then ambush their prey, the schemes of the orchid mantis are different. They sit out alone on branches or leaves and pose as flowers rather than hiding amongst them. Nothing says \"nature is intense\" like hot-pink bug-eating flower bugs.\n6\nof 14\nDomestic Pigs\nClose-Up Of Piglet At Farm\nManop Boonpeng / EyeEm / Getty Images\n\nSome domestic pigs are black because they overproduce the pigment eumelanin, while pink pigs don't make any melanin at all and end up a \"default\" pink.\n\nBut here's what's fascinating: Pigs evolved compelling coat colors only after domestication because of a human penchant for novelty, according to a study looking at wild and domestic pigs.2 As it turns out, pink pigs would not have survived in the wild long enough—because they would be easily detected by predators—to allow for the pink-producing mutations to have occurred.\n8 Surprising Facts About Pigs\n7\nof 14\nSea Stars\nnumerous sea stars colored from a light pink to maroon on the sea floor\n\nMakri / Pixabay\n\nThere are around 2,000 different species of sea stars, and they come in a range of colors, including pink, which help them camouflage or scare off predators. One can find sea stars living in oceans all over the planet, from tropical habitats to the cold seafloor. Marine scientists have adopted the challenging task of renaming these charming echinoderms \"sea stars\" instead of the once-common starfish.\n8\nof 14\nElephant Hawkmoth\nbrown moth with pink markings on plant with red leaves\n\nGale Hampshire / Flickr / CC BY 2.0\n\nThis pink and olive green moth—which has the unusual distinction of being named after a mammal, a bird, and an insect—is one of 1,400 species of hawk moths found across the globe. The colors help them attract a mate in the dark, and during the day, they hide among the bright pinks of the blossoms on their favorite foods: willowherbs and fuchsias.\n\nHawkmoths are the only moths able to hover in front of flowers to feed, like hummingbirds do, and are among the planet's fastest flying insects, reaching speeds of up to 12 miles per hour.\n9\nof 14\nAmazon River Dolphin\nThe Amazon river pink dolphin with speckled skin pokes snout of water\n\nchem7 / Flickr\n\nThe Amazon river dolphin—also known as the boutu, boto, or bufeo—has the distinction of being the largest of the freshwater dolphins, and happens to turn pink as it ages. In 2018, IUCN listed Amazon river dolphins as endangered.3 Primary threats include the use of them for fish bait, fishing with explosives, and contamination of the river water by mining operations.\n10\nof 14\nAxolotl\nPortrait of an axolotl\nArgument / Getty Images\n\nAnd here, the most charming salamander in all of the salamander world, the pink Axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum), also known as the Mexican walking fish. They do come in other colors such as white, black, yellow, and green. White axolotls always have pink fringed gills; black axolotls have gills of blue.\n\nNot only are these amphibians just ridiculously cute, but they never undergo metamorphosis and thus stay in larval form their entire lives. Plus, they have super healing powers that allow them to do things like regenerate limbs.\n8 Fascinating Facts About the Axolotl\n11\nof 14\nSea Anemone\nA pretty pink anemone underwater\n\nJayme Godwin / EyeEm / Getty Images\n\nNamed after the terrestrial flower that is equally showy, the sea anemone comes in a rainbow of dazzling colors, pink being among the loveliest. The color of the sea anemone depends on where they call home. If their host is a coral or sponge, they tend toward vibrant. In a more drab environment like a rock, muted colors reign. But this creature that's related to coral and jellyfish is more than just a pretty flowery glob; the anemone has some surprising traits. For example, they are carnivorous, can live to be 50 years old, and some of them can grow as large as 6 feet in width.\n12\nof 14\nPink Hairy Squat Lobster\npink fuzzy marine crustacean wanders in ocean\n\nSubaluna / Shutterstock\n\nPart Dr. Seuss, part arachnophobe's nightmare, this beguiling marine crustacean known as the “pink hairy squat lobster” (Lauriea siagiani) is not a lobster at all. Also called a fairy crab, the \"lobster\" belongs to the group of crabs called Anomurans and is just a half-inch long. The pink color allows it to camouflage perfectly on the pink giant barrel sponges the squat lobster calls home.\n\nThe pink hairy squat lobster can be seen in action in the following video.\ndeo.\n13\nof 14\nNudibranch\nPink Dorid Nudibranch, Bali\nReinhard Dirscherl / Getty Images\n\nThe beautiful pink Tritoniopsis elegans, a marine gastropod mollusk that is often confused with sea slugs, first was scientifically discovered in the Red Sea. The range of this nudibranch spans the western Indo-Pacific. Of all the wildly beautiful traits that these creatures possess, their color is perhaps the most remarkable. Ranging in a spectrum from soft and dessert-colored to neon rainbow, they have evolved these hues for means of both camouflage—when matching their environment—and as a warning.\n14\nof 14\nFlamingo\nLove by heart\nPhotography by Marcio Ruiz / Getty Images\n\nWe couldn't do a gallery of pink animals and not include the most famous pink creature of all. For our final blushing beauties, the epitome of pink: flamingos. Although when flamingoes first hatch, they are a drab grey; they develop into glorious shades of peach and coral primarily because of their diet. The red and blue-green algae they eat is chock-full of beta carotene, which contains a reddish-orange pigment, and the mollusks and crustaceans flamingos favor also p",

Although the recycling rate for PET plastic bottles in the U.S. is a meager 29.1%,2 this category is regarded as highly recyclable compared to other types—it's picked up by most curbside programs and able to withstand the recycling process several times, depending on what it becomes in its postconsumer life. \n\nWhen PET plastic is turned into a non-food container, it may be able to endure a second or third round of recycling, but when it's spun into polyester fiber—most often the case3—then it becomes more difficult to recycle because large-scale postconsumer textile recycling doesn't currently exist. \nPlastic #2 HDPE\n\nHigh-density polyethylene is used to make bottles for beverages, personal hygiene products, motor oils, and laundry detergent. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, it's recycled slightly more frequently than PET plastic (29.3% versus 29.1% of the time).2 HDPE plastics are picked up by most curbside recycling programs and often turned into pens, plastic lumber, plumbing pipes, and toys. Its thickness and durability make it easier to withstand the recycling process repeatedly.\n\nIn an experiment testing the recyclability of HDPE, ESE World B.V., a European manufacturer of waste and recycling storage systems, reportedly found that HDPE can be recycled 10 times; however, the study was conducted under highly controlled conditions that don't mimic mainstream recycling systems.4\nPlastic #3 PVC\n\nPolyvinyl chloride—the stuff faux leather, vinyl flooring, and shrink wrap is made of—is not as commonly recycled. It's more challenging to break down for reprocessing because it's composed of so many different compounds and additives. Some sophisticated processes can separate these compounds and make new PVC for things like pipes, carpet backing, and fencing, but the difficulty and complexity of this process make it unlikely that the compounds would be strong enough to withstand recycling more than once.\nPlastic #4 LDPE \nPerson throwing plastic bags in a yellow bin\n\nSeamind Panadda / EyeEm / Getty Images\n\nLow-density polyethylene is the dreaded \"single-use\" soft plastic that often winds up in the ocean, where marine life tragically mistake it for food. Grocery bags, sandwich bags, and cling wrap are made from it, and these items are not commonly accepted by curbside services, but an increasing number of supermarket drop-off programs are cropping up around the country. Typically, LDPE can be recycled only once because the quality is so degraded it can only be used for carpet treatment, trash can liners, and other single-use items.\nPlastic #5 PP\n\nPolypropylene is what hard prescription bottles, deodorant containers, medical equipment, and bottle caps are made of. According to AZoCleantech, a trade publication for the clean technology industry, PP can be recycled four times—into clothing fibers, brooms, garden rakes, and the like—however, only about 1% of it gets recycled despite 72% of Americans having access to PP bottle, jug, and jar recycling and 47% having access to PP cup, bowl, and tray recycling.56 Though it isn't as widely accepted by curbside services as, say, PET and HDPE, PP can be mailed into Preserve, a company that recycles #5 plastics via its Gimme 5 program.\nPlastic #6 PS\nStyrofoam food boxes stacked in the trash at park\n\nwingedwolf / Getty Images\n\nPolystyrene, the category that contains Styrofoam, is widely considered the least planet-friendly plastic. This is the material that disposable cups, takeout food containers, egg cartons, and packing peanuts are made of. Traditional PS is not recyclable because it's formed from a liquid hydrocarbon that can't be broken down by standard recycling methods and is too costly to process; however, expanded polystyrene (EPS), a rigid cellular plastic used for building insulation and electronics packaging, is. \n\nEPS is not accepted by most curbside recycling services, but you can search for a local drop-off location on Earth911. Postconsumer EPS is often made into plastic lumber and molding trim, so it can be recycled typically only once.\nPlastic #7 Other\n\nResin code #7 is used for miscellaneous plastics like polycarbonate (PC), used for CDs, laptop screens, and shatterproof windows, and polylactide (PLA), a biodegradable \"plastic\" made from corn starch or sugar cane. Not many curbside services will pick up #7 because it's such a catch-all category. (Some do, though, so check with your local solid waste management office.) Certain types, like PC, can be recycled, but others, like PLA, can't be. The good news is that PLA is compostable in some facilities—just look for the PLA code under the chasing arrows. ",

      "blog_post": "n January 8, the American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF) and John Deere signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that will give American farmers the right to repair their own John Deere machinery. This is an agreement that's been a long time coming and is the result of many years of lobbying for change. \n\nPrior to this, farmers were forced to rely on authorized John Deere dealerships and technicians to fix any problems that arose with tractors, combines, and other heavy equipment—a requirement that prolonged repair times (often at crucial harvest times) and significantly increased the cost. Farmers were barred access to parts and software codes, despite owning their (very expensive) machines. Extensive recent consolidation means that there's only one John Deere dealership chain for every 5.3 million acres of farmland and 12,018 farms in the U.S., forcing farmers to travel long distances to seek repairs.1\n\nNow, thanks to the MOU, any farmer or independent repair facility can do the job, diagnosing problems and accessing tools, information, and resources in a way that, according to AFBF president Zippy Duvall, still protects the company's intellectual property rights and ensures equipment safety. It more closely resembles the way cars are repaired. You can take it to the dealer or an independent mechanic or do it yourself. The point is, it's now the customer's decision. \n\nThe MOU is a private agreement between the manufacturer and customers that strives to address a problem without state or federal legislation—which, despite its best intentions, is seen to create \"a different set of problems or did not address agriculture,\" according to Sam Kieffer, vice president of public affairs for AFBF.2 In fact, the MOU goes so far as to say that the AFBF will agree to \"refrain from introducing, promoting, or supporting federal or state 'Right to Repair' legislation that imposes obligations beyond the commitments in this MOU\"—a stance that might prove contentious to some.\n\nThe MOU makes a distinction between the \"right to repair\" and modifying a piece of equipment. From Progressive Farmer: \"Part of the marching orders in negotiating a policy with Deere was to focus on the right to repair but differentiate that issue from modifying a piece of equipment,\" since \"AFBF supports intellectual property rights.\"2 The MOU will be revisited semiannually by both parties to assess its effectiveness.\n\nThe general attitude is celebratory. Duvall is quoted in Farms.com, saying, \"A piece of equipment is a major investment. Farmers must have the freedom to choose where equipment is repaired, or to repair it themselves, to help control costs. The MOU commits John Deere to ensuring farmers and independent repair facilities have access to many of the tools and software needed to grow the food, fuel and fiber America's families rely on.\"\nA Pro-Repair Decision\n\nThis is a great step forward for the right-to-repair movement in general. We've written about this before on Treehugger, how ownership should include access to parts and information, and that things should be built for repairability, if for no other reason than it's far better for the planet. When repair options are complicated or difficult to access, depending on the value of the item, people will often give up, throw away, and replace.\n\nI've called repair is a deeply environmental act. It prolongs an item's lifespan, reduces demand for new, conserves resources and save money. \"It keeps items out of landfills, which decreases the risk of leaching chemicals and heavy metals, and spares developing nations from having to deal with a surplus of unwanted goods in unsafe conditions. It incentivizes quality production, decreases toxic mining, and creates jobs in independent repair shops.\"\n\nApple was lauded for lifting restrictions on repair back in 2021, when it released its Self-Service Repair program, with parts, tools, and manuals available for its phones and computers. Ideally these would be used by \"individuals with the knowledge and experience to repair electronic devices,\" as these jobs are considered out-of-warranty, but I suspect that most people would not tackle such a job if they did not feel confident; nobody wants to mess up their iPhone! But the point is, people should be allowed to choose.\n\nIn this particular case with John Deere, the MOU allows farmers to do what they've always done, which is fix their own equipment at their own pace, in their home environment, which allows them to get on with the very important job of growing food for the rest of us.\nView Article Sources\n",

We've become accustomed in the Northern Hemisphere to buying ripe tomatoes in January, when they're six months out of season for us (even when they taste flat and flavorless), so to switch completely over to a local seasonal diet is out of the question for many. However, we can make an effort to eat as much fresh local produce when it's available locally, which not only helps us increase our fresh fruit and veggie consumption, but also helps local growers by increasing demand.\n\nWhy do I love local seasonal produce? Let me count the ways...\n\nFirst, eating fresh produce when it's perfectly ripe and has traveled a very short time and distance is a completely different experience than just eating some food because you're hungry. It's more flavorful because it's ripe, it's less bruised or handled because it's local, and you can often taste it before you buy it, so you know what you're getting. It just tastes better.\n\nSecond, an increased demand for local food can support a more diverse local economy, with local farms, urban garden plots, CSAs, and backyard market gardens able to not only feed more people, but to also make a sustainable living while doing it.\n\nThird, most locally grown produce has a much smaller footprint than mass-produced food, thanks to its shorter transport route and potentially fewer fossil fuel inputs. Of course, with modern heating, cooling, and lighting technology, we're rapidly becoming able to grow anything anywhere with enough power, so the lower carbon footprint claim may not be accurate for all local foods in all locations (you could probably grow local organic bananas in a lighted heated greenhouse in northern Montana, but at what external cost?), and certain economies of scale and pricing for big ag can skew both the input and margin numbers away from favoring some local foods.\n\nFourth, during peak harvest times, an abundance of fresh produce is usually available, which generally means lower cost, and often quantities of produce labeled 'seconds' (slightly blemished fruits or veggies) can be had for a steep discount, which can then be either consumed immediately, or preserved (frozen, canned, dried) for later in the year. And these ripe vegetables and fruits are often not only at the peak of flavor, but the peak of nutrition as well, so buying and 'putting up' food seasonally is a frugal old-school way of ensuring a healthy year-round diet.\n\nFifth, and a little on the woo-woo side, I believe that eating more seasonally and locally can help us gain a stronger connection to the natural world, and to the rhythms of the sun and the soil and the water and the changing seasons, and it also offers a great opportunity to better acquaint ourselves with the people and places that grow our foods.\n\nOne way to make sure you're staying in the loop for local produce, especially if you're not a gardener and don't know what ripens when, is to [wait for it] just go to the farmers market or farm stands yourself and ask what's good and what's coming ripe soon. However, there are often regional and local harvest calendars (try checking with your local Cooperative Extension Office or gardening club) that can be used to guide your local produce buying efforts. But another way, a more modern app-ified approach, puts a seasonal food guide right in your pocket, with coverage of all 50 US states just a few taps away.\n\nA new app from GRACE Communications Foundation (GRACE), the aptly named Seasonal Food Guide, is available for both Android and iOS, as well as on the web, and it includes information about more than 140 common types of produce. The app is free, and users select their state and the desired month to see a list of everything that is normally available in that region during that month, along with a basic availability calendar, and links to recipes and other information about that food. Users can also search directly for a specific food to see when its harvest time is, which could come in handy if you don't want to miss out on a particular favorite.\n\n    Never waste time in the produce section again! With info on 140+ fruits, veggies, legumes, nuts and herbs, the Seasonal Food Guide App is the most comprehensive digital almanac of seasonal, local food available. \n\n",

      "blog_post": "\n\nWhile I confess a love for many of the trappings of modernity, my inner Edith Wharton longs for the simple pleasures of a 19th-century life. I daydream of sitting in the parlor writing letters to a sister or suitor, pages filled with swash-flourished script and the sound of an ink-dipped metal nib scratching along the paper. And yes, my vision of Victorian living is completely romanticized. I am sure I'd abhor the lack of human and civil rights, modern sanitation, medicine, and the like. But still, it's a rather sustainable idea to be able to simply grab a pen and sheet of paper to write a letter, rather than having to rely on a computer and printer and all the various supplies and resources required to simply convey a few lines of thought.\n\nI loved when my daughters started learning cursive in school, and was surprised to hear from parents at other schools that their children weren't learning how to write in script. And indeed, in 2010, the Common Core standards stopped requiring the teaching of cursive in public schools. \n\nThe ability to read cursive matters as well. As Michel Martin points out on NPR, \"many of the most important historical documents in the U.S., everything from the Declaration of Independence to the Bill of Rights, are written in cursive.\" What happens when we require a translator for our most precious founding documents?\n\nBut it appears the tide is turning, and the curly-cued linked letters—and block printing, too, my personal print of choice—will not go down without a fight. A number of states are now requiring the teaching of cursive in schools, a revival encouraged by educators, researchers, parents, and politicians. And it's a good thing. While typing and digital files have been great in stemming a tide of paper waste, when used judiciously, writing things by hand has numerous benefits that we should not be in a rush to lose sight of.\n\nConsider the following:\n1. It Improves Learning\n\nA study published by the Association for Psychological Science found that taking notes in longhand, not laptop, improves comprehension, concluding that \"laptop note takers’ tendency to transcribe lectures verbatim rather than processing information and reframing it in their own words is detrimental to learning.\"\n2. It Encourages Brain Development\n\nA report in Psychology Today describes the importance to brain development of learning cursive, during the course of which \"the brain develops functional specialization that integrates both sensation, movement control, and thinking.\" Brain imaging shows how engaged the brain is while learning cursive:\n\n\"To write legible cursive, fine motor control is needed over the fingers. You have to pay attention and think about what and how you are doing it. You have to practice. Brain imaging studies show that cursive activates areas of the brain that do not participate in keyboarding.\"\n3. It Makes for Better Composition\n\nResearch reveals that students who write essays with a pen write more than those who used a keyboard; they also wrote faster and in more complete sentences.\n\nDeborah Spear, an academic therapist based in Great Falls, tells the Washington Post that cursive writing is an integral part of her work with students who have dyslexia. \"Because all letters in cursive start on a baseline, and because the pen moves fluidly from left to right, cursive is easier to learn for dyslexic students who have trouble forming words correctly.\"\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports on research that finds that by engaging fine motor skills, memory, and more, writing by hand acts as a good cognitive exercise for aging brains.\n4. It Helps Achieve Goals\n\nOf handwriting lists and achieving goals, researcher Dr. Jordan Peterson tells Forbes: \"It appears possible that writing, which is a formalized form of thinking, helps people derive information from their experiences that help them guide their perceptions, actions, thoughts and emotions in the present... Clarifying purpose and meaning into the future helps improve positive emotion, which is associated with movement towards important goals....\"\n\nDr. Marc Seifer, a graphologist and handwriting expert, says that writing a soothing sentence is a type of \"graphotherapy.\" Writing a sentence like \"I will be more peaceful\" at least 20 times per day can actually make one more peaceful, especially for those with attention problems. \"This actually calms the person down and retrains the brain,\" Seifer says. \n5. It Fosters Intention\n\nAnd to all of this, I will add that a certain intentionality comes with forming letters on paper, one that is lost when tapping plastic buttons. As technology increasingly makes our world more and more automated, we run the risk of losing sight of what we think and write. For me, there is a real-world tactile sensation, rather than a haptic one, that helps center thinking. There is no auto-correct or grammar suggestions or the potential of AI to guide one's thoughts, it's just you and your pen and paper.\n\nAnd if nothing else, there are few things that compare to receiving a handwritten letter in the mail (that gets delivered by a human being to a physical mailbox). \n\nMaybe I'm just old-fashioned, but some traditional skills are too lovely to lose, especially when they come with so many benefits that don't require an office full of electronics to receive.\nThe 11 Best Eco-Friendly Notebooks\n",

      "blog_post": "\nGarden\n\n    Urban Farms\n    Planting Guides\n    Indoor Gardening\n    Insects\n\nWriting a farm business plan can be a tool for you to plan your farming business. It can also be a requirement of securing grants and loans for your farm business. The process of writing a farm business plan may seem overwhelming and intimidating at first, but if you break it down into its component steps, it becomes much more manageable.\nWhat Is a Business Plan?\n\nA business plan is a roadmap for your small farm. It is both process and product. During the writing of a farm business plan, you'll develop an overall vision and mission for your business. You will think about your short- and long-term goals. You'll define the steps needed to achieve those goals. You'll set the direction for your business to develop over the next five years.\n\nIf you're already an established business, your new business plan will show where you're going next. A good business plan should be:\n\n    Realistic\n    Simple\n    Specific\n    Complete\n\nMission Statement\n\nYour farm’s mission statement is your overarching purpose for your business:\n\n    Why does your farm exist?\n    What purpose does your farm serve?\n    Where is your farm headed?\n\nThis is beyond “make money.” This mission statement is based on your values and your core identity as a small farm.\nGoals\n\nThe goals in your business plan are the specific, measurable “things” you will achieve with your small farm. Short-term goals are defined as those that you will complete within one year. Long-term goals are those that take longer than one year to complete.\n\nSMART Goals are:\n\n    Specific\n    Measurable\n    Attainable\n    Rewarding, and have a\n    Timeline​\n\nBackground Information\n\nIn this section of your business plan, take inventory of what you have right now:\n\n    Where are you located?\n    How many acres of land are you farming?\n    When did you begin farming?\n    How are you currently operating?\n    What general practices do you use for such things as conservation, tillage, environmental impact, and marketing?\n\nFarm Strategy\n\nThis is where your business plan gets to looking forward. You are going to formulate your farm strategy from now into the next five years or so.\n\n    Gather information and research markets. Make sure that your farm plan fits into the general market in terms of supply and demand. Investigate and analyze industry trends, identify competitors, and define buyers.\n    SWOT Analysis. This is an analytical tool that can be used in making decisions. SWOT stands for: strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. As a business, analyze your internal strengths and weaknesses. Then look externally at what opportunities and threats exist - competitors, new markets, government regulations, economic conditions, and so forth.\n    Create alternative strategies. Looking at the information you've gleaned and the analysis you just did, think through options for your farm strategy. Don't rely on price alone; economies of scale are challenging on the small farm level.\n    Don't jump to one conclusion immediately. Really spend some time fleshing out the specifics of some of the strategies and looking at their advantages and disadvantages. Try to find options that combine your internal strengths with opportunities in the external environment.\n    Look at all your strategies, then reread your mission statement. The ideal farm plan will fit your mission best.\n    Write an implementation plan. This is where you write a plan that will make your new strategy happen.\n\nMarketing Strategy and Plan\n\nIn the next part of your farm business plan, you develop and outline a marketing strategy for your products and services. This can build on the research you did in the previous step. For each product, include ​the price, placement, and promotion ideas. Consider how you will convey real and perceived value to your customers.\nManagement Summary\n\nThis part of your business plan details your farm business’ structure. Everyone who is involved in the management of the business should be listed here. External resources are listed here as well.\nFinancial Analysis\n\nIn this section, you will need to detail the financial aspect of your farming operation. List your current finances in detail, including all income and operating expenses. Referring to your new strategy, you will forecast what is needed for future growth and to meet the goals you have outlined in terms of capital. Include what your future operating expenses will be.\nPulling It All Together\n\nWriting a farm business plan is a big project. Don’t let that put you off. Your plan can be as simple as it needs to be for right now. Begin with your mission statement and goals. Do your homework by analyzing markets and researching competitors and trends. Have fun brainstorming alternative strategies and let them marinate a while. Take it one step at a time.\n\n    classic red barn with grain silo with large trees and blue sky\n    How to Start a Small Farm Business\n    Urban Farmer Transporting Freshly Harvested Pumpkins In Wheelbarrow\n    How to Start a Small Farm\n    Woman in straw hat carries two gallon buckets down garden rows outside",

More specifically, EISA aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 9% by 2030.1\n\nWith these goals in mind, EISA contains provisions that establish pilot programs, research and development initiatives, and grant programs to help fund a national commitment to energy efficiency. At the time of its enactment, it served as a continuation of the efforts made under the Energy Policy Act of 2005.\nWhat Is Energy Security?\n\nEnergy security is the connection between national security and the availability of natural resources for energy consumption. This element of national security may be threatened by political and economic instability around foreign oil supplies, increased competition for resources, natural disasters, and the effects of the climate crisis. Efforts to move the U.S. toward greater energy security include reducing the nation’s dependence on imported energy, decreasing overall energy demand, and investing in alternative energy research.\nSummary of the Law\n\nOriginally named the Clean Energy Act of 2007, the Energy Independence and Security Act was initially aimed at reducing subsidies received by the petroleum industry. Following opposition in the Senate, the focus of the bill shifted to promoting development of renewable energy like biofuels, improvements to energy efficiency in public buildings, and increases to automobile fuel efficiency. The following are the main areas of concern of the law:\nImproved Vehicle Fuel Economy\n\nTitle I of EISA amends the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards that were originally established under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 (EPCA). CAFE standards were originally set for cars that were produced in 1978, but were modified over the years and remained at 27.5 miles per gallon from 1985 to 2010. Title I of EISA was the first increase in standards since 1975 and has resulted in improved fuel economy, increased consumer interest in fuel economy, and a higher market share for fuel-efficient options.2\n\nIn addition to establishing several programs aimed at improving vehicle technology, title I, subtitle B created the Plug-in Electric Drive Vehicle Program, which provides grants to governments, transportation authorities, and other entities to encourage the use of electric vehicles. Other programs created under subtitle B include the Advanced Battery Loan Guarantee Program and the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Incentive Program. Subtitle C imposes vehicle emission requirements on federal vehicle fleets. \nIncreased Production of Biofuels\nGas pump nozzles in a row\nPhotoAlto/James Hardy / Getty Images\n\nTitle II of the Act amended the Clean Air Act (CAA) by expanding the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program. In addition, EISA defined the types of fuels that qualify: ethanol, biomass-based diesel, biogas, butanol, and other fuels derived from cellulosic biomass. It also increased long-term renewable fuel goals to 36 billion gallons and extended applicable renewable fuel volumes through 2022. Title II, subtitle A also grandfathered in volume allowances for certain existing facilities.3\n\nSubtitles B and C of title II outline research and development efforts for biofuels and impose requirements and limitations on the infrastructure needed for biofuels. Among other requirements, subtitle B calls for grants for biofuel production research, and the study of E85 fuel, engine durability, and biogas optimization. Subtitle C amends the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act to add requirements regarding renewable fuel. Title II, subtitle D of EISA also amends the CAA to include a waiver for fuel or fuel additives that will not cause or contribute to the failure of emission control devices or systems. \nImproved Standards for Appliance and Lighting\n\nPursuant to title III of the Act, manufacturers of appliances and lighting are subject to a number of new efficiency standards meant to decrease energy use as a path to national security. This portion of the Act includes two major provisions.\n\nSubtitle A amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) by inserting external power supply efficiency standards, updating appliance test procedures, and adding efficiency requirements for residential boilers, furnaces, central air conditioners, heat pumps, and various home appliances. There are also provisions regarding energy conservation standards for battery chargers and standby mode.\n\nLikewise, subtitle B amends the EPCA to include language regarding the energy efficiency of incandescent lamps. The Act also amends a portion of the United States Code to insert energy performance requirements for public buildings in the construction, maintenance, and leasing of space. \nEnergy Savings in Buildings and Industry\n\nThe goal of title IV was to reduce the energy use of federal buildings by 30% by 2015. Pursuant to the Act, this involved improving energy efficiency in residential buildings (including public and assisted housing), commercial buildings, and federal buildings. It also aimed at providing grants to build energy-efficient schools and promote sustainability and efficiency at other public institutions. \nEnergy Savings in Government and Public Institutions\n\nTitle V of EISA details requirements for improving energy in the U.S. Capitol complex, federal agencies, and other public offices and institutions like the Department of Energy headquarters building and the United States Coast Guard. More specifically, this portion of the Act imposes requirements regarding solar panel use, E85 fuel, and other types of energy, as well as limitations on the types of appliances permitted for use by federal agencies.  \nAccelerated Research and Development\n\nAs an important element of achieving energy security, research and development is addressed in title VI of the Act. Under subtitles A, B, and C, the Act requires the creation of research and development programs to explore solar energy, geothermal energy, and marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy technologies. \n\nWhile the requirements vary for each energy source, programs must generally lead to the development of more cost-effective and accessible technologies that can be used in residential and/or commercial applications. Subtitle D of title VI addresses energy storage in the transportation context.\nCarbon Capture and Sequestration\nCarbon Capture to Fight Climate Change\nImage of carbon capture technology which uses filters to remove the green house gas carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

What’s more, it acknowledged the importance of public health and safety and drinking water standards when developing carbon sequestration technology.   \nImproved Management of Energy Policy\n\nTo get ahead of anticipated challenges related to changes in the United States’ energy policy, title VIII of the Act enumerates various improvements to energy policy management. This portion of EISA outlines the mechanics of a national media campaign to increase energy efficiency and awareness of the benefits of energy security. It also amends the administration of the Alaska Natural Gas Pipeline Act, coordinates the closure of refineries prior to their removal, and provides for the assessment of data resources over a five-year period.\n\nTitle VIII also identifies prohibitions required to improve management of the U.S. energy policy under the Act. For example, the Act makes it unlawful to directly or indirectly manipulate the market for crude oil gasoline or petroleum distillates. Likewise, the Act prohibits the reporting of false information related to the wholesale price of crude oil to a federal department or agency. \nInternational Energy Programs\n\nTitle IX of the Energy Independence and Security Act is aimed at providing assistance to foreign countries for the promotion of efficient energy technologies. The goal of subtitle A is to create market conditions and an environment conducive to the adoption of efficient energy tech, and to promote the use of American-made clean energy technologies. \n\nThese efforts, which apply to countries including India and China, involve assigning Foreign Commercial Service attachés to lead business development outreach and educate government officials on the benefits of energy efficiency. Subtitle B establishes the International Clean Energy Foundation, which — among other responsibilities — is charged with making grants to promote foreign projects aimed at reducing emissions. \nGreen Jobs\nMulti layered businessmen with green wall\nHiroshi Watanabe / Getty Images\n\nCited as the Green Jobs Act of 2007, this portion of EISA amends the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 to include energy efficiency and renewable energy worker training program. Most notably, the legislation includes $125 million in annual appropriations for training workers for jobs in the clean energy sector.\n\nPrograms under the Green Jobs Act include the Pathways Out of Poverty Demonstration Program, which provides grants to training entities that will serve low-income families, and the State Energy Training Partnership Program, which gives grants to states for the administration of energy efficiency workforce development programs. \nEnergy Transportation and Infrastructure\n\nThis portion of the Energy Independence and Security Act amended the United States Code to create the Office of Climate Change and Environment (OCCE) under the Department of Transportation (DOT). The OCCE was to coordinate with the United States Global Change Research Program, and was charged with coordinating and implementing research, strategies, and actions of the DOT as they relate to transportation-related energy use and climate change. \n\nAdditional subtitles within title XI include creation of the Advanced Technology Locomotive Grant Pilot Program for giving fuel efficiency grants to railroad carriers, and establishment of the Short Sea Transportation Initiative aimed at encouraging the use of inland and coastal waterways when moving commercial freight.\nSmall Business Energy Programs\n\nTitle XII of EISA tacks a section on to the Small Business Act that creates express loans for renewable energy systems and energy efficiency projects. It also amends the Small Business Act to reduce the fees charged for energy efficiency loans. Finally, title XII includes provisions implementing the Small Business Energy Efficiency Program (expanding upon the Energy Star for Small Business program) and a pilot program encouraging small businesses to offer telecommuting options to employees — among other programs.  \nSmart Grid\nSmart Grid conceptual abstract\nchombosan / Getty Images\n\nA smart grid is an electricity grid that includes operation and energy features like advanced meters, load control switches, and smart appliances to improve efficiency, renewable energy resources, and fiber broadband to help monitor grid systems. The Energy Independence and Security Act commits the U.S. government to modernizing the nation’s electricity infrastructure to better meet future demand. \n\nThis involved establishment of a Smart Grid Task Force, the development of a smart grid technology research and development program, and the coordination of a framework for operating smart grid devices. \nPool and Spa Safety\n\nOften cited as the Virginia Graeme Baker Pool and Spa Safety Act, title XIV of EISA was added in response to the drowning death of Virginia Graeme Baker when she was trapped underwater by the suction of a spa drain. \n\nIn addition to imposing drain cover standards and equipment requirements in public pools, title XIV created the State Swimming Pool Safety Grant Program, whereby states can receive funds to train safety personnel and educate pool construction companies, owners, and operators about equipment requirements and other drowning prevention methods. \nEISA Current Status\n\nSince the enactment of the Energy Independence and Security Act, the United States has made huge strides in improving energy efficiency nationwide. In fact, it's estimated that by 2030, changes implemented in EISA will be responsible for a 15% reduction in daily oil use (an almost 3 million barrel decrease per day), an 8% reduction in annual projected energy use (8 quadrillion Btu), and a 10% reduction in annual carbon dioxide emissions (50 million tons).5 \nAmendments to EISA\n\nIn July 2019, a bill was introduced to amend the Energy Independence and Security Act to reauthorize the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant Program through fiscal year 2025. The bill further revises the program by expanding permissible uses of grant funds to include energy distribution technologies.\n\nIn September of 2019, the Department of Energy released two rules to roll back specialty light bulb standards established under EISA. These standards, which were scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2020, were aimed at improving the energy efficiency of light bulbs. It was estimated at the time that the final determination could result in $14 billion in extra annual energy bills for U.S. consumers.6 In light of this uncertainty, six states (Vermont, California, Washington, Nevada, Hawaii, and Colorado) passed legislation to implement their own efficient lighting standards before the January 1 deadline.\nView Article Sources\n\n    Smog over Los Angeles, California\n    The Clean Air Act: Summary and Impact\n    15 Things Obama Has Done for the Environment\n    Person replacing a conventional light bulb with an energy efficient one.\n    Energy Star: Overview, Certification, and Sustainability\n    Air source heat pumps in front of an apartment building\n    International Energy Agency Says Heat Pumps Are Hot\n    Energy Secretary Granholm and President Biden are in the news",

      "blog_post": "It’s here. After months of flirting with warmer weather in the Northern Hemisphere, June is finally here to welcome back BBQs, sunscreen, water balloons, firepits, camping, gardening, and everything else warm-weather delicious, fragrant, and visually arresting. Depending on where you live, it’s also one of the few times of the year when the stars above face some fierce competition from the fireflies below. Welcome back, nature—we’ve missed you. \n\nIn celebration, check out some of June’s nighttime (and even daytime) highlights below. Wishing you clear skies! \nImagine the Beauty of the Arietids Meteor Shower (June 7) \n\nWith a peak display of more than 60 shooting stars each hour, the Arietids are one of the best meteor showers of the year. There's only one problem: they're nearly impossible to see. Unlike the Leonids or the Perseids, the Arietids are one of a few meteor showers that peak during daylight hours.\n\nDespite the sun obscuring much of the Arietids' fiery display, there's still a chance to catch some before sunrise on the mornings of June 7 and 8. And if waking up early to see shooting stars is disagreeable, why not try hearing them? The Arietids are also known as a \"radio shower\" due to the way their intense speed (upwards of 75,000 mph) through Earth's atmosphere creates whining radar echoes. According to NASA, you can listen to them burning up by simply using a ham radio.\nView the Sweet Beauty of the Super Strawberry Moon (June 4) \n\nJune’s full moon, nicknamed the “Strawberry Moon’’ after the ripening crops of the eponymous sweet fruit, will reach its peak at 11:43 p.m. EDT on June 4. Alternative nicknames for the month’s full moon include the honey and/or mead moon (so named for the spring crop of honey gathered from European honeybees) and the blooming moon or green corn moon. \nWake Up and Enjoy the Earliest Sunrise of the Year (June 14) \n\nWhile the summer solstice on June 21 is the longest day of the year, it's not the one with the earliest sunrise. What gives? There are a variety of factors that influence this quirk involving the speed and slightly elliptical path of Earth's orbit around the sun and the tilt of its axis. The math all adds up to make the earliest sunrise about a week before the summer solstice and the latest sunset about a week after. The exact date of this depends on what latitude you reside on. So, for instance, if you reside in the mid-northern latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, or Boulder, Colorado), you could expect the earliest sunrise of the year to occur on June 14 at 5:31 a.m. Either way, it’s a great excuse to grab a cup of coffee, sit outside, and revel in the impending return to summer. \nJune’s New Moon Welcomes Dark Skies (June 18)\n\nThanks to a late New Moon on May 30, June will kick off with some exceptionally dark skies. For the first week at least, you can train your eyes, binoculars, or telescope and be treated to pristine views of galaxies, shooting stars, and other wonders otherwise dimmed by moonlight. \nPinwheel galaxy with a supernova highlighted\nThe new supernova in the Pinwheel Galaxy.\n\nFlorian Runger / Wikimedia Commons / CC 4.0\n\n Need a target? This month, in honor of summer’s official arrival and the discovery of a new supernova, we’re recommending The Pinwheel Galaxy (M101). Discovered in 1781 by Pierre Méchain, and located some 21 million light-years from Earth, this face-on spiral galaxy stretches 170,000 light-years across (our own Milky Way, by comparison, spans an estimated 100,000-120,000 light-years) and contains around a trillion stars. On May 19, 2023, a Type II supernova was observed occurring within the Pinwheel Galaxy, the first from that region since 2011. With the New Moon removing troublesome moonlight, you should be able to easily spot the new supernova with a small telescope. \nWhy Dark Skies Matter\nWelcome the Summer Solstice & Longest Day (June 21)\n\nThe summer solstice, the astronomical start of summer in the Northern Hemisphere (and conversely, the start of winter in the Southern), will occur on June 21 at 10:57 a.m. At this moment, the Earth will be at the point in its orbit where the North Pole is at its maximum tilt. For those of us up North, this gives us our longest day of the year with anywhere from 13 hours and 45 minutes (Miami, Florida) to 19 hours and 21 minutes (Anchorage, Alaska) of daylight. With the Sun directly overhead at noon, it’s also the day that you’ll cast your shortest shadow. After the 21st, we’ll once again start losing daylight and begin the long march back toward the darker days of winter—so enjoy it while you can! And just after the sun sets…\nLook West To View A Celestial Trio of Mars, Venus, and the Crescent Moon (June 21)\nDark sky with Mars, Moon, and Venus\n\nStellarium\n\nWhile Venus will put on a show after sunset all month long, it will be joined by a thin crescent moon and Mars during dusk on the evening of June 21. Cap off the longest day of the year by watching this trio welcome the shortest evening of the year. \nGrab a Drink, Relax, and Enjoy the Year’s Latest Sunset (June 27) \n\nJune 27th, for us northern dwellers, marks the year’s latest sunset, with locations like New York City watching the sun slip below the horizon at 8:31 p.m. EDT. While you’re at it, stay up a few more hours to….\nCatch the Bootid Meteor Shower (June 27)\nDark sky with an outline of the constellation Bootes\nLook to the western horizon a little after midnight on June 27 to spy some Bootids.\n\nStellarium\n\nThe end of June brings the return of the Bootids meteor shower, an annual event that (thankfully) can be enjoyed during the evening hours. Well, \"enjoyed\" may not be the right word, as the Bootids are notorious for having extremely weak displays, with as little as two to three shooting stars per hour. The reason they're worth mentioning at all is because some years, they've littered the sky with streaks of light.\n\n On June 27, 1998, as many as 100 meteors per hour fell over the course of the seven-hour event. According to Spaceweather, similar outbursts occurred in 1916, 1921, and 1927. Could 2023 join that historic group? To give the Bootids a shot, look towards the constellation Bootes, which lies to the left of the Little Dipper.\n",
